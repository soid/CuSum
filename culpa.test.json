just write a concise sentence.\noverall, i'd suggest this to students that have a decent science background already, rather than someone that is maybe a literature major. i learned a lot about a

(see you on the other side). be thankful if you are lucky enough to take this class from him. the course is fun and the material is engaging. whatever you do, don't come to class and sit on facebook or watch youtube videos. listen to what the man is saying. his stories are intense and personal, and what's more is his passion for relaying his interests and experiences to his students. it helps to have an appreciation for caribbean musics, i admit i probably wouldn't listen to every genre explored in this class recreationally. but the point is that to understand modern hip-hop, reggaeton, and reggae, you need to have the background of the earlier colonial music styles. each lecture consists of the hypnotic voice of washburne, paired with musical examples from each genre explored. the course covers musics of puerto rico, cuba, the dominican republic, haiti, jamaica, and trinidad and tobago.", "more than 350 people were already registered for this class when i was picking my fall classes; of course it seemed like a bad choice! \"what can i learn when there are this many people in a classroom?\", i thought to myself. but i went with it at my adviser's recommendation and because it was the only one that fit my schedule.\nholy shit, what a class.\nchristopher washburne is a hell of an entertaining instructor. when he starts telling his stories all 350 students are dead-silent; and this is probably the most important part of being an lecturer. if you can't be entertaining, you simply won't get your message across. prof. washburne knows how to get his message across. he's extremely passionate about caribbean music and salsa in particular, and this makes for delightful lectures.\nthe class follows a format that approximately covers one caribbean country a week. cuba, puerto rico and jamaica are the big ones and might take longer to go through, but there are many others too. you not only learn about the music per se but all aspects that revolve around it: social, political, economical, etc. essentially, this allows you to appreciate not only *how* the music sounds but *why* it sounds the way it does.\nwith 3/4 of the semester in, i can honestly say that this is one of my favorite classes ever. even if you, like me, aren't interested in caribbean music at all, i highly recommend you take it.", "washburne is one of the best professors that i have had while in college. he is excited about the material that he is teaching and it clearly shows during his lectures.the class lectures are extremely diverse and he covers many different musicians from the earliest origins in blues and ragtime to modern day jazz musicians. he is extremely accessible during class and tries to learn all of his students' names. additionally, he is very lax in terms of grading and gives plenty of extra credit opportunities! i highly recommend taking this class music major or not. he makes the class easily understandable to those who do not have musical background.", "professor washburne is the man. such a cool dude. least stressful class i've taken so far. so relaxing to listen to music for homework. if you are interested in jazz at all, take it. professor washburne has very interesting stories about his life as a professional musician and his travels and also teaches the standard jazz narrative well. very doable for nonmusicians. copious amounts of extra credit. if you do the extra credit and make an effort on the concert reports, it's an easy a.", "be warned that washburne has a pretty big ego and likes to go off on tangents and  talk about his encounters with famous people...a lot. that said, this is a good class, and washburne is a very good lecturer (although theatrical at times). with washburne you get the additional benefit of the perspective of a working jazz musician. i came out of the class knowing a lot more than i did going in, and who can complain about listening to great jazz for homework? the readings are very interesting as well, though not entirely necessary. exams weren't too brutal, but because of the size of the class grading is firm. if you're a musician (especially a jazz musician), this class is an absolute breeze - unless you take washburne up on his offer of doing a final project instead of the three concert reports the rest of the class has to do (you still have to go to the concerts, but only need to hand in one page). stick with the concert reports.", "far be it from me to disparage this man.  he's an exciting lecturer, who cares deeply about the music.  being in a class with him is a joy, as he is a showman when it comes to lecturing.  he is able to present the information, but he has fun with it as everyone in the class does too.\nall the previous reviews say this.  i feel it's true, so moving on...\nthe warning i will give is this: the man does not care at all about the students.  he really does not care about you at all.  if you go to his office hours, he will answer emails while you are talking to him.  in person, he is as cold as he is warm in his lectures.  not mean, not nasty.  just cold.\ndoes this mean he's a bad person, or that you should not take his classes?  absolutely not.  the classes remain some of the best classes at columbia.  however, i just need to add this little warning for anyone going into class, that there is a distinction to be made between him in class and him in person.", "by far the best class i have taken!! i am not a music major and i really enjoyed this class. washburne is an engaging professor and really inspiring. class is great- he always has interesting stories to tell about celebrities and jazz musicians. studying for the midterm and final takes longer than you expect but its not hard and its fair. he practically tells you the essay questions beforehand. also, if you dont know any music, like i didnt, study in advance- listen to the music a few days before the midterm/final to get acclimated. take this class take this class take this class- best to take it with friend because studying will be easier and going to jazz performances will be more fun.", "i don't hate washburne, but feel that all these raves are a bit misleading.  i took the class because it sounded interesting.  it had its moments, but i found that if you don't have a deep passion for jazz, you might find  yourself annoyed with washburne's somewhat arrogant enthusiasm.  he's  one of those professors that has developed a cult following, which, if you're not part of it, gets to you after a while.  if you like the guy, i guess, you can get past his habit of repeating everything about 4 times and the way he self promotes his band in class.  i ended up sneaking out of lectures half the time, and paying for it on the exams.  others seemed to have a better experience than i did, but i'd recommend sitting in a few lectures before registering, because he's not for everyone.", "if you want to remember your academic experience fondly, then all you need to do is take a class with professor washburne. he is the kind of teacher who normally exists only in fantasy. he is brilliant, sweet, hilarious, passionate, and, maybe best of all, extremely interested in his students. whether you are a jazz fanatic or novice, you will leave his class with both a strong interest in and understanding of the music.", "i was expecting this course to be a purely musicological course on jazz but i was very happy to learn some social history as well.  as everyone else has said, washburne is really funny and thorough at the same time.  he brings in a variety of different perspectives on jazz and is very responsive to students' input (remarkable in a lecture of 200 people!)  you get to listen to examples of what he's talking about in class, and he stops the music frequently to explain the importance of what you just heard.  you do not need a musical background to do well in this class, and you certainly don't need to be a music major, although it helps to have taken music hum.  i would recommend this class highly.", "i would encourage anyone to take this class. i loved it. i would list it as one of my top five best classes at the university; as a major, it was definitely the best one in the music department. yes, it is an elective, and non-majors can take it, so it doesn't cater to hardcore music theorists or historical musicologists. however, the music is fun and fabulous, and washburne delivers interesting and funny lectures. furthermore, the most important thing i took away from this class was a newfound appreciation for caribbean cultures. i even learned to salsa dance!", "thus far, the best class i have taken at columbia/barnard. everyone should take this class. prof washburne is funny, laid back, sincere, an extremely talented, rare professor. i think what i liked most about him was how sincere he was to us, and how much he loved the material. the class was 150+, but he made it feel like we were just all hanging out. his lecture style was never aloof or boring, but as though he was sharing what he loved with a few friends. he is an extremely talented musician, as well (has his own band, used to play for tito puente). even if you don't like music, or jazz (or don't think you do), take it anyway.", "washburne is highly overrated.  while it's amusing to have a professor throw \"cool\" words into his lectures, his simplisitic understanding of the history of the caribbean is painful.  washburne makes highly generalized statements without any accurate historical information to back them up.  granted, he is passionate about music (go hear him at smoke- he's wonderful)  but passion can only keep a student interested for so long.  unlike other classes at columbia, which sometimes have an overly academic feel to them, there is no scholarly element to this class at all. i learned close to nothing and was also bored. washburne should keep his evening job as a musician.", "washburne is an engaging and entertaining lecturer.  if you know nothing about jazz, this class will introduce and educate you about its history, its major figures, and its evolution.  if you know something about jazz, this class will be an enormously easy 'a' and you will learn things here and there that you didn't know.  the listening material is fantastic and the grading is done by competent and intelligent tas.  i highly recommend this course.", "not like he needs any more praise, and naturally anything described as great is bound to build expectations and disappoint, i nevertheless feel the need to shower praise where it's due.\nthis course is amazing.  i have been heartbreakingly disappointed with nearly every one of my classes at columbia over the past 3 years, even to the point where i left school.  this class makes me glad i came back.  the professor is engaging and passionate and provocative and the subject matter is really genuinely interesting.  but i can still imagine a professor making jazz boring.  prof. washburne excites students about jazz and music in general, and even incorporates larger issues such as art/music's role in society, racism, social/political context, and gender issues beautifully.  he is truly a fabulous professor.  not to mention the ta's, who are accessible, funny, informative, and fair.  this course is wholly fulfilling - the subject matter, the professor/ta's, the books, the concerts, everything.  kids aren't skipping his late-afternoon springtime classes - doesn't that say something?  can columbia please hire profs based on their teaching ability as *well* as their accomplishments outside of the classroom?  instead of just the latter?  prof. washburne does both; he is a figure in the jazz scene in the city as well.  he is truly a great asset to columbia.  don't miss this class!", "phenomenal teacher!!!! extraordinary. his enthusiasm and the great music make it worthwhile 9am class. i strongly recommend this class to anyone, irregardless of your interest in music. he really is a columbia gem. attending lecture is a must, since exams are based on material taught in class (but if you pay attention then the exams are easy). theres no need to do the reading except that the book is very clear and fun to read-i ended up doing all the readings on the syllabus.", "this review is intended for advanced music majors, so i don't mean to offend everyone else who loves washburne. he is one of the most popular professors at columbia, and he has a sort of cult following among music majors who don't know much about jazz but do realize that it's some of the best music out there. and he's okay as far as teaching a basic introductory survey of jazz to people who know nothing about it. but for someone who already knows a lot about music, his classes (i've taken several) are very elementary. if you've even heard of eric dolphy, then v2016 will be way too easy for you and you'll get frustrated with washburne's factual errors. if you're a music major who just wants an easy a, then this is fine if you can sit through it.", "all of the other reviews seem extremely exaggerated. washburne is good in that he is a fairly enthusiastic lecturer. also, he knows a fair amount about music itself; he was good at explaining basic musical concepts. however, there were several downsides to his class. he presented a simplistic view of history; he often just repeated truisms to explain historical periods. he told several stories, that while amusing, simply weren't true. for instance, his description of how berlioz came to compose the symphony fantastique was just totally wrong. what's more, the correct version is in the textbook. another example is he presented a theory of the origins of beethoven's deafness as fact; nobody is actually sure why beethoven went deaf. this led me to wonder whether other implausible sounding stories he told both about his personal experience and about the lives of composers were also untrue. also, he really didn't challenge the class very much, it could have been taught at a much higher level. while i did learn a fair amount about music, i felt like i could have learned a lot more. far too often, washburne seemed willing to simplify things rather than deal with a more complex, but more accurate version of reality. on the whole, a decent, but not terrific professor.", "if you don't take this class before you graduate they should strip away your ivy. washburne is unbelievable. his lecturing is so engaging that i would often find myself checking the time and wishing i had double period washburne. additionally, the music that we listened to was amazing (some might say orgasmic). i never loved jazz before this class, but i am now addictted to the genre (i just bought 5 jazz cds and can't tear myself away from the jazz pieces that are posted for the class). you will leave this course with a comprehensive understanding of the musical and cultural progression of jazz from its inception through today. take this class!! take this class!! take this class!! a funny and passionate teacher, great material, a ticket to explore the city and its music scene-this class has got it all. put it this way, everyone that i spoke to was neary depressed when the last class ended. if you can't fit it into your schedule then stay another semester.", "professor washburne is one of the best professors i've ever had at columbia. he's humorous, approachable, and interesting. he's obviously knowledgeable, and i learned more in that class than i have in most classes at columbia. his lectures are interesting and informative--when he lectures, he tells a story; i never fall asleep in that class. i know much more than just music history; i know now the personal lives of the musicians, the politics behind the music, and so on. he's an excellent teacher.", "this guy is probably one of the better professors that you'll ever have. his knowledge and background with the music that is studied (he's played with tito puente, mark anthony, whitney houston, etc etc), is extensive and his feel for the music is great. although the course is lecture based and can be a little boring at times, his humor and stories about his experiences lighten things up. of course, you get to listen to music of the caribbean styles, and get to see how they influence the music we all listen to today. he really wants you to learn and appreciate the music rather than just cram for tests and go to concerts just for the assignment.", "coolest professor at columbia. maybe even in the ivy league. maybe even in the world. jazz was a really fun class and latin music's his specialty, so take both jazz and salsa, socca and reggae with him. you will not regret it. however, a lot of people take the class because they see it as an effortless a. but you need to go to class, because (as every other reviewer has said), the tests are entirely based on lectures. don't even bother to buy the textbooks.", "i would take organic chemistry if professor washburne were teaching it. the class is a lot of fun and you learn a lot. he makes you understand jazz both from a musical perspective and from a historical and sociological point of view. textbooks are completely useless-- his lectures make up the midterm and final. know the stuff and you'll get an a. but let me reiterate: washburne is fantastic. take anything he offers.", "wow. the greatest professor i've ever had...knows everything there is to know about jazz, has fascinating stories from years in the business, hilarious, brilliant, passionate, engaging, etc., etc., etc. take this class now. take any class this man offers.

be considered mundane. topics included god and sex, god and race, god and caste, and god and translation, and although readings were heavy, each was genuinely interesting and relevant to our discussions. participation is a heavy part of grading and of the class experience, though you could survive the semester without a word if you sent in written reflections every once in a while. take this class!!", "gil had an interesting teaching style. he always asked for questions at the beginning of lecture, but didn't always seem to get around to answering them. he just kind of talked about what he had planned and then if something was related to a question, would point that out. i guess he took questions to encourage participation, but i had no motivation to ask a question because i didn't think it would be answered. pretty much everything he said was interesting, though.\ntoo much reading. there weren't many assignments so reading was basically the only thing we had to do, but it was impossible to get through it all. i ended up doing very little of it on a weekly basis and then doing what was necessary for the midterm and final paper.\nthe only reason i'm hesitant to say i'd recommend is because gil added an attendance policy after the drop deadline, and students could only miss 2 classes. that was pretty annoying for someone who hadn't been missing very often, but wanted the option when necessary.", "this course is not one to have expectations of, and, to his credit, prof. anidjar is very up front about this fact. his lectures appear to be improvised, and are usually based off of whatever questions from students he can scrounge up--promulgated usually by the 25% of your grade that comes from class participation.\nthe texts are exceedingly difficult and his lectures have to be reflected upon, but if you're willing to really think about them it's probably worth your time. the review sessions held before the midterm and the final by tas were essential to understanding the course, but attendance is also important--even though at times it feels futile.\nhe said in one class, and it became a theme, \"it is impossible to evaluate a class until five years after it ends,\" so perhaps this review is futile. that's kind of how the whole thing goes, anyway.", "well, for a professor that turned up in \"america's 101 most dangerous professors\", or whatever, i was expecting at least one psychotic episode in class, or maybe just a good solid racial slur, but got neither. what i did get however was a well instructed lecture. here's how professor aninijar runs things:\nfirst, he comes in and trys to get everyone that is in the class to get an easy a to peace out, but being incredibly boring the first two classes.\nafter the drop deadline, and half of the class vacated, he starts instructing. he does so by mentioning some news article or current event. this story, that is articulated very casually, is then used as an anchor exhibit for say.. foucalt, or some other reading we are focusing on that week.\nwe did'nt cover a rolodex of the world religions in this class because as the class trys to communicate, the dividing done to these religions, filed away in these nice names, is a warp on religion itself.\nsomething to know before taking this professor's classes: he does not give a flying f*ck about what your idea of a \"normal\" course is, or how bad it will ruffle your feathers to do something out of the box.", "if you want to take a comparative religions class, this is not the course for you!  the reading list includes some books that relate to religion and many that do not.  the goal of the course is to rethink the way we consider religion and to \"relinquish religion,\" but the majority of the class time was spent not analyzing religion or actually learning anything, but rather discussing bits and pieces of the books and then getting majorly sidetracked.  although professor anidjar knows his material and is a wealth of information, the course failed to actually teach anything substantial.  about half the class didn't even bother coming to lecture, and i found myself often needing to drink coffee to avoid falling asleep in class.", "although called religion 101, this course provided no information on religion in the way one would expect. we did not study judaism, christianity, or buddhism, but rather spent class time having (granted entertaining) irrelevant discussions on books that no one in class read. the books cost me over 300 dollars and i read at most a chapter out of each one because it is not necessary and they were all quite long. there was no motivation to read, or even come to class for that matter since attendance was not taken-- even though it counted for a third of our grade? the discussions were very interesting, and the professor is clearly brilliant, but i didn't feel like i learned anything other than how to see religion in different ways (as sexual difference, law, ect.). interesting in theory but a rather disappointing class in terms of taking away any kind of learning experience. one positive thing is that gil really makes you think and often asked the class to ask questions that could not be answered; however, this does not constitute an entire course. global core, woohoo.", "this course was on neither jews nor arabs. don't bother taking it if you're looking for a course that, in some way, fits that description. if you are, however, looking for a course on unicorns or forks (i'm not even kidding) you might consider taking gil's class. most classes were spent doing deconstructive readings of texts which would end up branching out into abstract, philosophical discussions which no one, not even those participating, actually followed. this is where the extensive discussions on unicorns came up. three classes were spent on one word in said's orientalism. the week after, we actually zoomed out and read the sentence from which the word came. if close readings of texts are your thing... enjoy! if not, this course will most likely baffle you. i could probably bs my way through some contrived explanation of how this approach to reading texts somehow relates to jews and arabs but... you'd have to be under the influence of something to buy it\nno syllabus. he verbally tells you which books to buy but don't even bother purchasing them-- you'll only end up reading a sentence in most anyway.\ngil himself is actually quite approachable and nice. despite feeling slightly misled by the course title, i actually enjoyed the class. that also might have had something to do with the a- at the end of a semester of no work with the exception of a 5-page paper (which i threw together the night before).", "most of the reviews posted regarding specific classes with professor anidjar are accurate. i wanted to share the experience of having professor anidjar as an ma thesis advisor. unfortunately, though i slowly warmed up to his strange and frustrating teaching style in class, as an advisor he was simply unpleasant. his notes on my drafts were unbelievably mean and sarcastic, completely inappropriate even when criticism was justified. even his personal email messages were often angry and in them he would constantly accuse me of misunderstanding his cryptic sentences. i felt there was very little i could do, since i might jeopardize my matriculation (at the actual thesis defense, he was much less harsh and passing was not a problem). i advise to avoid working closely with him at all costs.", "i cannot express how little he cares about this class, or teaching in general.\nhe will teach you to read in a different way, which is exciting once you get past the arduousness.\nit was aggravating to buy 15 expensive books and only read 5. so buy them one at a time..he doesn't follow any syllabus. and went spent the first part of the semester reading orientalism.\nbut for my grade, i thankful.", "he's no walk in the park (try derrida or freud!).  i was confused by him, but that should not necessitate that he was confusing.  it takes time to work on the level with him.  he's moving very slowly.  so slowly that i never caught up to him.  he can handle silence.  he listens well.  he'll appear to say things that he did not say, hence people calling him mean.  he sticks to his guns unless there's a strong enough point to convince him otherwise.  his thought provocations are reason enough to stand in the classroom if there aren't any chairs.", "the early reviews of prof. anidjar are correct, while the more recent ones appear to have been written by people who are out of their minds. prof. anidjar definitely thinks he has a good sense of humor, but this is only because he seems to have some idiotic groupies in the class who laugh at his jokes all the time (these are usually made at the expense of a student in the class, and are not very funny). he never prepares any actual material for his classes, instead allowing students to pointlessly pick apart sentences in the text, and doing so himself every so often. he tends to raise a lot of points about the sentences that make no sense or are utterly ridiculous (like, why was this written in the past tense and not the present? is it because the author is an orientalist? and why is there a comma there but not here? what does it all mean, really?) it's definitely the case that he likes to put students down, which i happen to think is not a useful educational tool, particularly in a class where you won't learn anything anyway.", "he is too cool for school, it's true, which is why all the women in the class are in love with him. he is certainly nicer to the women who speak up than the men, which does not say much, because he is not very nice to either. that said, he is an excellent teacher: he brought a new dimension to my learning at columbia by demanding that students look at not only individual words, but also syntax, and not only what a text says, but also how it says it (i.e. what does this sentence do? what does it produce in you as a reader? ). the only written assignment for the class was a final 10-12 page paper which required students to pick one paragraph from any of the texts we had laboriously and repeatedly read, and show how it means (through explication).\nthe class and the professor are both highly recommended because there is no bullshit--how rare!", "a decidedly odd man, i would highly recommend this class to anyone who is remotely interested in understanding how freud and derrida thought.  prof. anidjar cares deeply about the material and it comes across in his instruction, which is highly specific.  his strongest point is also his weakest:  he seems to believe that reading should be a slow and painful process.  the effort can be both endlessly rewarding and draining, and not always successful (nor, i suppose, should it be).  prof. anidjar adds new dimension to the phrase \"too cool for school\" and takes himself entirely too seriously (and yet, he is the most caustically sarcastic man i've ever met).  those however, are only personal observations, and on a whole, the class and prof. anidjar are highly recommended.", "while he may be condescending to some, he's a genius, and you'll be thankful you took him down the line.  you will not get away with saying any bs in this class.

tough.  this is just to scare people off and it worked because there was only about 12 students in the class left.  at times, he makes you feel stupid, but it's still a class you want to take.  he might be a tough grader, but in the end your grades don't count because the lowest he will give is a b.  stay in the class!!!", "gil anidjar takes time getting used to - he seems quite intimidating, serious, and anal about details from the get go, but as the class goes on, you realize that he's a pretty down to earth guy with a sarcastic sense of humor. the class is pretty intense and you're expected to read everything, or at least half of the book, by the first discussion on it. he forces you to back up your opinions with lots of textual references, and class participation is a must. overall, he's a good prof, but not for the faint of heart.", "ignore the negative reviews, which are mostly from those afraid of a challenge and who probably dropped out after the first couple of weeks. prof. anidjar, one of the leading biblical scholars of his generation, was quite simply the best english instructor i ever had. he'll make you work -- you do have to read an entire text before each class -- but it's worth it, though intimidating the first couple of weeks. he'll force you to question any preconceived, knee-jerk conclusions you're tempted to spew out without close reading and thinking -- and it carries over to real life when you're analyzing newswriting or watching what you write. a friendly guy with a dry sense of humor, too, whom you'll appreciate increasingly more once the class is over.", "great guy. he is not condescending in any way, in fact you get a feeling like he is \u00e2\u201cone of the guys\u00e2\u201d. always available after class and understands if you

mean, freshman have to write a paper a week for l & r (they don't know that, but as a sophomore, i do!). he also wants everyone to write a paper a week, in addition to the major papers. he digressed almost immediately, and stayed off topic for a long while. he also does not split the reading up. he expects the books to be read for the first class. since i'm a sophomore, i dropped this class immediately. i feel horribly for the freshmen who are stuck with him. good luck guys.", "gil anidjar is condescending, has a superior attitude, and even goes as far as to announce that he does not really believe in compliments. he typically spends the first half of class insulting students' work from the previous class. he rarely lectures, but rather lets students lead the discussion by talking about their favorite passages, while he observes with a sullen and bored expression on his face. when he does give his insight, it is typically philosophical garble about the relationship between the past, present, and future rather than specifics about any text. additionally, he has a poor attendance record and his strong foreign accent is often difficult to understand.", "i just wanted to say

after reading the old reviews, i found that compared to the past offerings, this course has drastically changed.\ni recommend taking this course if you want to formally understand various aspects of software engineering. it is most beneficial for students without prior work experience. however, as an experienced professional, i have learned a great deal about software testing.\nthe lectures were loosely structured. professor kaiser covered theoretical topics in-class via real-world examples, code snippets, and online resources. on many occasions, we discussed interesting topics such as autonomous driving software and testing ai systems. tas were helpful in troubleshooting individual assignments. sometimes shirish (head ta) gave in-class tutorials on tools/technologies used in the assignments. grading mostly seemed lenient for assignments and assessments. however, you need to be very careful about the requirements of the assignments/assessments.\ni felt that time allocation was not managed well. the first half of the course only had individual assignments. the team project started mid-october, so we had less time to develop an mvp. the online setup of the class (because of covid) was somewhat helpful in terms of collaboration with peers. but, starting the project early would have helped a lot in terms of applying what we had learned to the project.\ntake this course if you have little or no full-time industry experience. if you want to learn about se and software testing, then this course is great. this class is not about ui design/development. try other classes for front-end development.", "overall, i recommend not taking this course.\nthe ideas behind this course are simple: think in terms of the customer and plan your project accordingly. unfortunately, a lot of the documentation we do is not really meaningful, and the pace of the class could be faster. we spend several weeks on design patterns, and another several weeks on \"bug testing\", which is stuff you pretty much already know.\nif you want to challenge yourself on your road to becoming a fully-fledged computer scientist, don't take this class. if you are looking for an easy course to take on the side, while knocking out your tech electives, you might consider ase. this class is not really \"advanced software engineering\", it should be called \"software project planning for enterprise\".\nthe midterm reflected the course. it was pretty easy, with just definitions and written explanations of concepts. but at the end of the day, how much did you learn compared to a class like os or algorithms?", "the class moves pretty slowly for a 4000 level cs class and covers the qualitative components of computer science (planning, group dynamics, etc). don't let the name fool you, there is nothing \"advanced\" about this course. it is interesting that we get to work on a project of our choosing over the course of the semester, but the amount of documentation we have to provide beforehand is a little infuriating. you end up spending 3x more time writing out requirements, risk, etc than writing code.\nyou will probably have to take this class because it is required for software systems, and let me say that this is not a \"bad\" class. you still learn concepts like design patterns, but ultimately you will learn much more if you take a class like operating systems or computer networks.", "i recommend _not_ taking this course. 70% of the work is document writing, drawing graphs, and typing stuff into jira, not difficult, but very tedious and boring. you do surprisingly little coding, which is ironic for a \"software engineering\" course. writing \"cool\" software won't score you more points in the class. if you absolutely must take this course, do not be ambitious about the projected you will create. you won't receive extra points because your project is \"cool\" or \"harder.\" most of your grade hangs on the writing/documentation you do -- and you will spend more time on this than anyone would want to. so make your software easy to document and easy to test. you really only spend a month or two working on it, the rest is over-excessive planning you don't end up following anyway.\nthe midterm and final will have you writing so much stuff! the first of the three questions test you on vocabulary (!) terms from the lectures/book. the second one is short answers. the last one asks you to come up with designs for proposed software and ask you to write more than what most people can do in the given time. if you take this course, do the test backwards. almost everything in the course is pedestrian stuff you know already: unit tests, version control, software testing, etc. the other stuff you might not have heard of, uml diagrams, burn-down charts, and spike testing, etc, are not complicated at all, and can easily be learned from the textbook.

class over five years ago. i am, in this very moment, listening to richie havens cover of jerry merrick's \"follow\" (something only those of you who have already taken roma's class would understand). you might be wondering why, after such a long time, i am now writing a review. to be fair, i have always wanted to write a review for his class. probably since the first day i met him, which was when he was selecting his upcoming class roster, which he did while concurrently complaining that he was being forced to accept virtually all seniors (i was a senior at the time).\ni left columbia for four years during my junior and senior year to pursue a life in another art form. when i returned to columbia, i had quite a bit more experience than most columbia undergrads. upon my return, i had heard that thomas roma was an artist (a term i do not take lightly), and i was immediately drawn to him. for those of you who are wondering if the mentioning of photo i on your resume will be hard to explain to your future bullshit employers or to your parents, please, just please, don't sign up for this class. this class is not for cowards. if you intend to live a cookie-cutter life, good luck. i am instead speaking to you young people who are drawn to the idea of thomas roma because you seek meaning beyond your dumbass gpa or your intro base salary. you may not understand this desire, whether it is real or merely some figment of your self-described \"privileged, first-world problems.\" but you are drawn, and this is the class for you.\ni majored in philosophy. when i was a second semester senior during my high school years, i recall telling an elderly alum that i was intending to major in econ. he scoffed at the idea of majoring in econ. he said, \"do something more interesting.\" i thought to myself, \"f--- this guy.\" well, the first year, i was an econ major. second year, first semester, i had an existential crisis. second year, second semester, i checked to make sure i still had my balls, temporarily became an econ-philosophy major, subsequently realized i was half-assing it, then demanded myself to pursue the one major i actually gave a shit about: philosophy.\nthomas roma is on my mind now because i have been in the real world (as a performing artist) for quite some time. every year, i get more rejections than successes. but for the past year, i have grown tired of my failures. i have lost the anger and drive that i immediately felt after every failure i had, which, in the past, i used as fuel to catapult myself to the next level. i have become apathetic. i have become an artist who thinks only of clocking in and clocking out, the very thing i despised that led me to my path in the arts.\nso this is why i think of roma now. he is perhaps the only artist who has not only been able to sustain his interest in his artistic expression, but also in his ability to speak so enthusiastically and eloquently about his pursuit, as if he is now just starting off in his career. you're not going to be a photographer. who gives a shit if you can take a great picture. he will teach you what it means to express and to care.\nmany of you are too young to know what i speak of. many of you are too stubborn to even consider the notion of apathy. but the real problem for an artist is not whether you will be able to withstand the pain of failure. it will be your ability to resist the urge to not care.\ni am desperately trying to shake this apathy from my soul. the memory of thomas roma might be one of the few things that could help me.", "professor roma is without a doubt the single most influential professor i have had during my four years here at columbia. he is a kind and wonderful human being. he is dedicated to his students, his craft, art, family, music. everything he does he does for a reason and with dignity.\nthe stakes of this class are high. professor roma treats his students with respect but he expects you to fully commit to his classes. he believes that everyone who walks into the first class of photo 1 is an artist and he treats them as such. that means students are expected to be able and willing to be intimate and vulnerable with their photography. if you are unable to do that, or unwilling to do that, do not take this class.", "the previous reviewer basically articulated all of my thoughts about roma word for word. i must give him more credit though.\ntaking both of the classes that he offers to his undergraduates, i can assure you that roma certainly embodies the term \"cult of personality\" more than any other professor i have encountered throughout my time year (i have another year left, but i doubt i'll meet any professor that matches up to roma's charisma). however, while i must say that, yes--my photography has improved after taking both of his courses, i do wonder how much i (and others who listen to his every word with the assumption that they are words of wisdom) could have improved even more if such a large part of my time in those classes was not spent on listening to his musings like a disciple. especially with his photo 3 seminar--which is handled much more leniently than photo 1--where much of the class is spent on chatting with roma and there is much less pressure to produce work consistently. as a result, i found myself scrambling at the last minute to put together the final project for that class. if you really want to improve your photography, definitely reach out to roma with specific questions and he will answer them, as well as the ta's. the ta's provide the helpful/technical counterpart to roma's philosophical take on the classes. but of course, roma is not a world-class photographer for nothing, he is of great assistance if you badger him in your office (which he loves!). don't be fooled by his intimidating and bully-ish aura (though you inevitably will be at first), he is honestly a very kind and dedicated person who is ready to sit with you in his office for hours and feed you yummy cannolis during the seminar.\nif you're gonna take photo i, definitely try to take it with roma, simply for the fact that it will be a standout class in your columbia experience, regardless of how much you end up liking/not liking it. be prepared to seek out for help on your photography skills and don't fall face first into the trap of roma's charm. definitely listen to what he has to say but don't assume that everything he speaks is passed down through god. like the previous reviewer said, he gets away with a lot more than other people do.\np.s. don't be afraid to disagree with roma on something he says! he is (somewhat) open to engaging debates.", "this class should not be called photo-i, it should be called thomas roma-i. if you want to immerse yourself in a semester of thomas roma, take this class. incidentally, if you're lucky, you might learn some photography as well. thomas roma embodies the phrase \"cult of personality.\" he is quite the personality: funny, witty, mean, kind of like the extremely self-assured bully. but i do believe that having high standards and expecting people to live upto them is a good thing, and definitely developed me in some way. having been the recipient of a number of brutal critiques, that often left me questioning my entire personality, i was definitely inspired to really think about why i was putting up the works that i was putting up and what they meant and in this sense the class was better than other workshops i have been in where professors are nice to your work whether they suck or are good. so as opposed to other people who didnt like him, i really was grateful that he was honest with his critique and called out things that sucked for what they were.\ndid my abilities as a photographer improve in this class. yes. however, the price one pays to obtain this in terms of feeding his enormous ego is almost not worth it. in a 2.5 hour lecture he spends about an hour or 45 minutes actually talking about why your photograph is good or why it sucks and spends most of the time relating random (and probably made-up) stories about his life that have nothing to do with photography. in critiquing your photo not only will he insult your photograph if it sucks but he will also make it a point to directly insult your personality and you as an individual, which to me didn't really matter that much but was quite unnecessary wrt to improving me as a photographer and was done more for his pleasure. he is an individual who knows that his popularity and cult-status affords him power and he definitely uses this power to the maximum and gets away with a lot of stuff that no one really could get away with. thus a lot of this class is in my opinion quite unnecessary. as opposed to the students who hung on every word he said as if he appeared in the clouds and ordered us to write all he said on stone, i was quite unimpressed by most of his stories. the most annoying part of the class was that we each had to ask him a question unrelated to photography, about his personal life, after each critique. so that is like 20 irrelevant stories per class already, not counting the ones he launches into during a critique. i kind of went there to learn about photography, not to fill his ego by laughing at and being audience to his stories about his girlfriends and mother and son and what-not. you have to really have drunk the thomas roma kool-aid deeply and fully to willingly sit through his lectures with wide-eyed wonder.\nin short my opinion of this class is that there is a lot of bull-shit, a lot of unnecessary insulting but in the depths of all this there is genuine honest critique to be found and genuine honest growth as a photographers to be realized. and that is actually pretty rare to find. so my final verdict is take this class, but take it with a an entire spoonful of salt", "if you're not sure about taking this class:\nthere are only two kinds of people at columbia. those who have spent a semester with roma and those who haven't. if you don't have a serious case of fomo yet, develop one (no pun intended).

right, you'll never be the same. don't be afraid! go towards the light.\npractical advice :\n- if you've never studied photography or looked at a photograph before that's more than fine, that might even be better, but learn the name of at least one photographer before the first day.\n- if you don't get into the class, keep showing up, he'll probably let you in eventually.\n- the tas do 100% of

tears apart your work (sometimes literally) but somehow does it in a way that's so helpful you end up wanting the criticism. and it's not a weird masochistic thing. because he's not attacking you, he's attacking the parts of you that you don't need, the aspects of your personality that are preventing you from communicating honestly with your photographs. it's basically a class on how to be a better human being. as he said in the last classes, it's photo i but it's also \"stop and think about it i\". just do it.", "you are doing yourself a severe disservice if you leave columbia university

inherent immaturity as undergraduate students, but in the end it doesn't even matter.  take this class if you are creative in any capacity.  what he demands from you is basically to put the most secret and sacred page in your journal up on the wall for everyone to see.  he knows when you mean it, and you will too.  as long as you're at least partly comfortable with this idea, please, please take this class.", "taking a class with roma is like a theatrical experience.  he screams, sings, plays great music, recites poetry, and is undeniably funny, even if it is at your own expense.  he is immensely honest with his students about the details of his life - he ends critiques by allowing each student to ask him a question about literally anything but photography - and his stories will really make you think.  taking a class with roma was without doubt the best decision i have made at columbia so far, as other reviews have said, and i recommend it to anyone with a backbone.  go into critiques expecting criticism (everyone is criticized), and when (*if*) he says something positive, it actually means something.  another note:  he does not grade on the inflated columbia scale.  some people do the work and still do badly.", "mixed feelings.  i agree with all of the positives and all of the negatives that have been stated.  it's all true.  if you're serious about your creative work, you may find this the single most useful class you take at columbia.  if you can't handle burning criticism, you may find yourself hurt - damaged, injured, disabled - by this class.  if you can, you may find yourself incredibly inspired one week, bored the next.\ni would add three damning criticisms, in terms of roma's pedagogy, to those levied in other reviews:  1, in the end, it's very difficult to control your grade in this class, because the criteria are never clear, and they won't even discuss your midterm with you, let alone tell you how you're doing.  2, you have to make the ta's work for you or you're not going to learn much about the mechanics of photography - and yet, you'll be judged on those mechanics to some degree.  3, don't ever argue with him during your critique.  just nod and look like you understand, or you will be sorry at the end of the semester.\ni'd say those three criticisms add up to a pretty negative picture.  and yet, i'm very glad i took the class, and i think most people are.", "everyone at columbia should take roma's class.  he doesn't really teach you anything directly, but somehow you end up with a better understanding of the world in general and definitey yourself.  and your photos will get way better, if you're into that.", "you will most likely have mixed feelings about this class.  roma does provide a good intro to photography and you will probably be left a bit inspired by his brand of absolute truth.  but sadly, in the end, his rants get a little old.  his revolutionary attitude starts to wear thin when you realize the circumstances of his life, how he achieved success; how he spends his life making pictures for fatcats on the upper east, then lectures to their progeny.  in the end, his philosophies on life boiled down to admonishments to 'let go.'  i think there are more responsible and better informed thinkers, more effective teaching methods, more ultimately caring people [he doesn't even want to know your name].", "first of all, tom roma is not an asshole; to be fair, i do agree with many of the contentious points about roma made by the other reviewers. yes, he is a tyrant, but  you will come

about interesting issues. being that it's a small class, you also get to work with people and get to know them, something i could not get in any lectures. gm laurie is very kind and also has a good sense of humor, and really makes an effort in working with her students by encouraging one-on-one meetings. the class is quite a bit of work at some points in the semester - the athens game, for

over her feedback before writing our revisions. she also provided us with a lot of supplementary material to help us understand the reading (glossary for difficult terms in older french, etc.), which i admittedly didn't use but i'm sure was very helpful to those who did. this class was very small (maybe 6 people) so participation was a huge part of the class (structure-wise, not necessarily

(if they were not in the class, i'm not sure what would have happened.) the only times where i felt like i learned anything was when a student would push him on a topic and ask a great question, and he would be forced to try and answer the question. however, he didn't even do this effectively all the time, and sometimes the questions appeared to annoy him and he would cut off the person asking the question and give a very terse response.\n- assigning work: he assigned homework very irregularly. there were no assignments in the entire second half of the class. the time it would take to do each one was completely variable. this was only the case because he didn't plan them out with any thought, instead just selecting a couple of problems from a textbook chapter. on one occasion, one of the problems required a third party data set that we did not have access to. when students brought this to his attention, he was surprised. the midterm was a disaster. he did not have a set date for when he wanted to hold the midterm exam; students would ask him almost every single class when he would hold the midterm, and he didn't set a date until a week before the designated university midterm week. instead, he scheduled a take home midterm for two weeks after spring break. and the final exam... the instructions were just incomprehensible gibberish. i literally had no idea what he was asking us to do. he clearly spent about 5 minutes putting it together and failed to proofread anything, because it is fraught with incomplete sentences, duplicated text, etc. (for example, one of the questions was not actually a question. it was just a bunch of half-baked statements in some bullet points. unreal.)\n- class scheduling: he ended every single other class 5 to 30 minutes early. (30 minutes early!!! holy crap!) he wastes time in each class stumbling through his laptop trying to find files. he attempts to do class demonstrations in r but then fails to do them because he can't find the right file. over the course of the semester, he didn't come in to four classes - one absence was due to a sudden family emergency, which is a totally legitimate reason to miss one session. but he missed the next session as well for the same reason, when he had ample time to form a contingency plan (e.g., have the ta teach the class). another time, he couldn't get into nyc from his home in connecticut because of the weather. he attempted to hold a video conference class lecture, but it was totally ruined by technical issues, so it was essentially useless. inexcusable.\nthe material itself is interesting and potentially such an important topic to understand (big data, analytics, etc etc), and i am genuinely upset that i wasted credits, tuition dollars, and time on this course.", "professor emir is awful. i am writing this having (unfortunately, because of requirements) taken two classes with him in the last two semesters. i attended every class both semesters and did well both times (at least from the grades i have so far of applied data mining), so while many people are critical of their professors when they do badly and/or never show up to class - i was there the whole time and really know how bad he is. the only way i was able to do well in these classes was by spending excessive time reading and re-reading the textbook and other materials i found online and going to office hours as often as i possibly could. i learned absolutely nothing from professor emir.\nhe comes unprepared to class. yes, there are lecture slides that he has to pull up on the screen, but he does not prepare any of these himself. the slides consist of either screenshots of the textbook pdf and entire lectures using slides he found online (i've found them online too). when he goes through the lecture slides during class, it is often clear that going through them during class time is the first time he has ever looked at them (because whatever he has on the slides doesn't even make sense to him).\nfor applied data mining, he never graded the midterm. it was a 5-hour take-home on the thursday after spring break (march 26). i am writing this on may 16, after all our final exams are over, about 7.5 weeks after we took the midterms - we still haven't gotten our midterms graded (and, he did originally say that he would email us individually with comments on the midterms. so that is clearly not happening). also, 3 or 4 weeks after we took the midterm, a number of students asked him when we'd be getting feedback on the exams. he did not give us a clear answer, and he said he \"did not have time\" to even begin grading them yet. the ta also said during her office hours that he had not asked her or the grader for any assistance grading the midterms.\nhe simply does not respond to emails. actually, he apparently responds selectively to some students and not to others. this has been especially problematic since his instructions for the homeworks and the take-home final have consistently been unclear.\non at least one occasion, during his office hours (8-8:40am before class and he is often not there or makes personal phone calls) he realized a mistake he made in the assignment he had written. he told just the students who were present during office hours that we could skip the part of the assignment that he had written by mistake, and neglected to tell the rest of the class until the morning it was due, when in fact he had realized this mistake 3 days before. by then, most of the class (except for the 3 or 4 of us who were there during office hours) had spent hours trying to figure out the part of the homework that made no sense to begin with.\nthe day he assigned the take-home final exam/project (applied data mining), he showed up to class unprepared (no lecture slides), so he opened up a blank word document, and wrote out what our final would consist of. before then, he had clearly put no thought into it at all. if i'm not mistaken, writing out assignments is something professors should do before they show up to class - not during class, without any previous thought put into it. because of the lack of thought that he put into writing this assignment, the instructions were unclear, required that we do an excessive amount of work that we had never even seen before -- and again, because he doesn't respond to emails, an assignment that shouldn't have been so bad at all took an insane amount of time.\nin applied linear regression analysis, we had a group project that was assigned at the beginning of the semester - and it was supposed to be a semester-long project. however, professor emir continued to change the instructions until just a few days before it was due.\nif for whatever reason professor emir is asked to teach another class at columbia and you have to take it, just be prepared to learn everything on your own. he is not there to teach you or support you learn.", "the worst, most disorganized class experience i have ever had.\nhe never gave us a syllabus at the beginning of the semester. a syllabus should include: office hours; grade breakdown (how much of your grade will be based on tests and assignments); when the midterm is; when all assignments are due; etc. his syllabus merely had a list of chapters from the textbook that we would be studying and none of the essential items mentioned above. as a result, i have no idea what my grade will be, since i don't know how much of it will be based on assignments and how much of it will be based on exams.\nthe assignments were vague and expectations were never clear. when we would have assignments was also very unpredictable, there was no regular due date and he would often spring them on us a week before they were due, so it was very difficult to budget my time while taking this class. most professors usually have a regular due date every week for problem sets (psets are due on every thursday at 5pm, for example) or else the syllabus would include when they were due, but birol did not do this.\nthe midterm was a complete disaster. he did not tell us when the midterm would be at the beginning of the semester; we found out that the midterm would be on the day of the withdrawal deadline about three weeks before the midterm, so there was no way to withdraw from the class if you did poorly on the midterm. he also gave us very little information about the format of the midterm, so it was impossible to study for it. the midterm was also a take home midterm, the type where you open it in courseworks and you have a certain amount of time to do it before submissions close. he gave us five hours to complete the midterm, from the time you open it on courseworks, and he also only gave us one day during which we could complete it. the day he gave us to complete it happened to be a thursday, which was a day this semester when i did not have a five hour chunk of time to complete a midterm and he would not let me (or anyone else) take the midterm on another day, so i had to skip other classes in order to take the midterm.\nthe final project also did not have clear enough instructions. vague, vague, vague, no one knew what they were doing and (as mentioned below) he doesn't return emails, so there was no way to clarify the instructions.\nhe also is terrible with correspondence. he rarely responds to emails--i have heard of exactly one instance from everyone i knew in the class where he actually responded to an email; other than that, sending him an email was essentially sending an email to a black hole. he also still hasn't returned the midterm, even though we've already taken the final.\nbirol submitted grades two weeks late. he did not grade the final or the midterm, or if he did, it was never entered into courseworks. i have no idea how i made the passing grade that i did, as i only turned in one homework out of four and received no grade or feedback on either exam.", "this was the worst experience i've had with a professor. i tried to ignore the previous reviews and go into this class without a bias, but they're basically all accurate. professor emir is a nice person, but he seems to put the absolute minimum amount of effort possible into this course. we never received a syllabus. we never received a rubric or concrete description of our final project, which we spent the entire semester preparing for -- the project requirements, inasmuch as there were any, were changed the up until day before the projects were due. the fact that he is also teaching the applied data mining course next semester is unnerving.\nit was impossible to get excited about the way birol taught the material (as evidenced by the fact that by the middle of the semester, 15-20 people would attend regularly) -- and i started the semester eager to learn the material. i attended class basically every session, but i didn't get anything from lectures that i couldn't have gotten from the summary slides he posted -- which themselves were screenshots from other statistics departments or photographs of our textbook. he was also never available to meet outside class besides at 8 am before classes (but was usually late or not there anyways).\nit was good to get more familiarity with r, although it wasn't formally taught except for a crash course in the first week on (no joke) how to install it. the problem sets and project, however, demanded it. the lab sessions in the course description definitely do not exist.", "worst class ever\nhighly unorganized\ni still do not know what

ever wrote the review on culpa.\npeople on culpa do not recommed taking prof. caridi for stat1211; yes, i do not recommend him too, but compared to prof emir, prof caridi is clear, and has specific goal what he wants to teach every lecture.\nhowever, prof emir is nice person and easy grader. i think he just do not really care or does not know how to teach. i have learned nothing from the class. if you want to learn something, i recommend you to study by yourself or take other class.", "birol emir is really not so bad. intro stats had very little work when i took it with him and he's quite droll. that being said, his day job is pfizer and he commutes in from connecticur, so his focus is not teaching or even academia.\ndo the readings, do the problem sets, grin and bear it. intro stats is not the type of class to always be revelatory.", "professor emir is actually one of the nicest professors here and is highly unappreciated. the problem sets and project are not bizarre, they just challenge you to think a little. his slides are easily understood and if you do the reading and participate (and actually show up) you'll get allot of out them. he is an expert in using statistics in the real world and focuses on statistics methods that you will actually use. the biggest problem with the class is the students. it was mostly seniors and post-baccs who looked him up on culpa and picked him because it says the class was easy and it's w1111, which is one step above the lowest intro stats course here. they were all looking for an easy a and only 10% of showed up to lectures. i learned allot from him and did poorly in the class. i found the exams to be challenging (not ones you can cram for) and because he didn't baby sit you and give you home works you had to keep up with the reading (which i didn't do and suffered for).  most of these students had experience using much more advanced statistics in the lab and were whining because they wanted easy 100s on the quizzes. allot of cheating went on with the homework and some serious ass kissing was going on in the lectures.  most of the people complaining about him here are arrogant seniors and perfectionist post-baccs who never showed up to class except to complain. im not sure if i even passed but i have to say something because this professor does not deserve what these students are writing about him here.", "terrible, terrible experience. emir is incompetent. his lecture slides are right out of the book, the examples he gives are right out of the book, his explanations are right out of the book. a waste of a teacher. the examples he gives that aren't from the book are generally useless. his problem sets range from five-question packets that take half an hour to forty-problem p-sets that take days. he gets half of his tests and problem sets from outside sources and does not write his own p-sets or tests. he is inconsistent in his expectations.\nthe second midterm was a graduate-level project on statistical analysis and modeling that was actually a lab: totally inappropriate for an intro-level stats class. he handed us the packet and left us to our own devices for one weekend with no guidance whatsoever. the project was nearly impossible and the whole class had to talk with him for an entire class period to clarify his expectations for the project (even then, he did not provide a grading rubric). we had to approach the department head, who agreed that the project was ridiculous (he made us do it anyway). he occasionally takes attendance, which is the only reason anyone really attends class.\ni haven't finished with the class. it wasn't difficult; mostly inconsistent, confusing, frustrating, and extremely boring. avoid if at all possible.", "an utter embarrassment to columbia university, the department of statistics, and to the profession of teaching. he was absolutely terrible at teaching and extremely organized.\nhe will assign extremely bizarre exams and confusing assignments that will stress you out for weeks on end. because he teaches you absolutely nothing and wastes class time, you will have to dedicate a great amount of time to statistics outside of class.  he is totally unprepared for class and treats it like a joke. he will teach you nothing but will grade harshly and give unreasonable assignments.\ndon't be fooled by his grading system and the other reviews. he does not abide by the grading system and gives out grades arbitrarily. very random, tough grading (which the whole class was not expecting once they received their grades).", "below is my course evaluation for professor emir. i have not yet taken the final or gotten a grade, so i cannot speak to that.\nprofessor emir is the worst professor i have ever encountered. he did not communicate the subject matter coherently. he did not prepare adequately for class. his assignments were unclear both in the content (poorly worded questions) and the process (changing the requirements and the due date multiple times). as far as i can tell (everything in this class is really unclear), prof emir grades everything out of 110 possible points so that everyone will get good grades, regardless of his poor teaching.\nall of the material we covered up to the midterm was covered in my 4th grade arithmetic class (with the exception of how to take a standard deviation, which i both already knew and could have googled and learned in 5 minutes). he assumed that since the course was statistics without calculus, we had no prior math exprience at all and actually asked us if we knew what even and odd numbers were.\nin addition, he repeatedly made inappropriately classist comments (comments which assumed that and made fun of us for all coming from extremely privileged backgrounds).\ni have honestly never written a course evaluation like this, and i hope i never will again. i imagine that professor emir is a brilliant statistician at pfizer, but i should not have wasted my time in his class and i hope nobody else ever has to.", "[this was my submitted course evaluation]\nprofessor emir is an affable man, and he does care what his students seem to think of him. what he brings to columbia, though, ends there. class after class, he showed a remarkable lack of attention to and involvement in the course. he seemed minimally if at all prepared, and was generally disorganized. he clearly is a good statistician, but he was unable to bring much of his knowledge to the classroom.\nsome examples:\n1) he read verbatim from the stock overheads prepared by the textbook publisher, which just quoted verbatim from the book, thus rendering going to class, or doing the reading, redundant.\n2) when asked to introduce an example that wasn't straight from the book or slides, prof emir would show how unprepared he was; he once went completely silent for six minutes as he brainstormed an example, finally asking a student for a copy of her book and using something from it.\n3) when he did use the board to jot down an example or elucidate a point made in the slides (which happened maybe once per class on average) his writing was small and hard to read, and he was very reluctant to actually go through the steps of a problem, or treat multiple parts of a problem. (and don't let me forget the extra credit points he awarded to people who would do problems on the board for him!)\n4) prof emir several times changed the grading scheme for the course, but only after the relevant quizzes or homeworks were taken or dropped, as the case were. for example, the two quizzes went from counting 5% total (per the syllabus), to counting 10% each (per a february announcement), and then to 5% each (per a march announcement),\nand as of yesterday, back to 10% each.\n5) he also changed test formats more than once. the first quiz was multiple choice, but because a few students asked for a change, for the midterm he changed the format to open question. then, when that format proved too time-consuming to grade, he went back to multiple choice for the next quiz.\n6) prof emir was occasionally late for class, and occasionally would leave early, citing specific family/work obligations. this would be understandable if his only available times to meet with students weren't right before and after class.\n7) prof emir blatantly just did not respond to emails. tas weren't much better.\ndo not be misled by the unremarkable evaluations--many students are just happy to have found a professor who grades so leniently (i got an a with minimal work) and they don't want to rock the boat, or look a gift horse in the...you get it. but being ostensibly friendly and laid back does not make up for the lack of care prof emir showed. and as such i think it would be a shame if he were invited back next year without his promising to make some real changes, and put in a sufficient amount of work himself. tuition is too darn highto be spending it on this mediocrity.", "because the previous reviewer did not attend class frequently, i feel that he has a different point-of-view compared to someone who did. i attended every single lecture and let me tell you, this class is hard if you do not have any background in calculus or stats (which i didn't). if you don't read over the chapters before class, you will be very lost and that was my problem most of the time. my saving grace was going to the tas office hours. they were the only ones who could really help in terms of availability and teaching the material.

(note: the ta was amazing and he is the only reason this class was tolerable. he would have been a better teacher than herman.) in lecture, herman assumed we only lived and breathed physics from a young age, sometimes joking that we should've seen these things in kindergarten. i now realize he wasn't joking. once, when covering zeeman effect, he said he would \"snowjob it\" (he says snowjob means hand wave) because we had seen it in modern physics. last time i checked, modern physics was not a prerequisite for this class. is it even a class offered at columbia? https://vergil.registrar.columbia.edu/#/courses/modern%20physics nope! sometimes he was more reasonable and only required that we know quantum chemistry and thermodynamics, both of which were not prerequisites as well. i only say reasonable because this meant that 1 out of 12 students may know enough to teach us how to solve problems. but why does homework even matter? we found an inverse relationship between time spent on the homework and grades. why? because the homework was so irrelevant to the exams, which are worth significantly more. but you may ask, we also have these quizzes. surely the homework would help! if the homework problems came from left field, the quiz questions came from right field. they were incredibly uncorrelated, and incredibly difficult. on our last quiz, i found myself wondering if i was even in the right classroom, because i saw five (out of 5) questions of brand new material that had never been discussed. as someone who loved quantum mechanics, i found herman to be a terrible professor who constantly made me feel stupid. it was only the ta who made me realize that i was asking legitimate questions that had nontrivial answers. basically, i realized when herman said \"think about it\" it meant \"this is a really good question and i will not answer it.\"\nthere are some pros to this class though! the ta. that's it. i hope he is recognized for the hard work that he did. i think he may have been one of the best tas i've ever had at columbia. he was extremely approachable and wanted to help us, two qualities herman did not have. (i don't think herman even knows or name, by the way.) his homeworks were typed up in an ugly format on microsoft word (not latex). even when we finally deciphered the terrible notation, herman's grammar was so terrible that we often had to treat it like a literature assignment. i felt like i was enrolled in a 3000 level class called \"intro to quantum mechanics and hermanian grammar.\" you might as well change the call number from apph e for applied physics engineering to apcl un for applied contemporary language.\nthis class needs serious reassessment. i would have rather sat on amsterdam avenue in the rain reading griffith's quantum mechanics by myself every day without any friends, than take this class. but, even that isn't an option, because attendance factors into our grade, so i found myself at every lecture, hoping the class would either drastically change or end.\nnote to other students. if you have the option to take this class, drop out. you shouldn't have even considered it. i'm sure nyu or any cuny school has a better version of this class. in fact, i'm sure that any college in any universe or planet has a better version of this class.\nbut, if you can't avoid it, here's my advice. go to the ta's office hours - they are phd students in apam and will know their stuff. they know quantum is hard and will understand and will help you. work in groups! especially if you plan on finishing the homeworks. as for exams, the best advice i can give is to redo the problem sets once you get solutions, and do the problems in griffiths. chapter 2 blesses you with about 42 good problems in qm, and the solutions shouldn't be hard to find so you can always check if you're grasping the material. even though i have a lot of complaints, if you put in the work, you can definitely succeed.\nbut...thank goodness it is over.", "i had a pretty small/nonexistent background in quantum mechanics coming into this class, but i think prof. herman did a very good job teaching this course. the first day he gave us a survey, and i think he was slightly disappointed at the general lack of background among the class, but nonetheless adjusted his syllabus accordingly.  he always appeared enthusiastic about the material and imparted much of this enthusiasm into his daily lectures (sometimes interjecting \"this is fun!\", much the the chagrin of the class who were no doubt still attempting to wrap their minds around his latest hastily scratched down derivation.) he certainly moved quickly, unless he got caught up in something especially tricky, or couldn't read his own handwriting on his notes. at the end of the day though, he managed to squeeze everything he needed into the lectures to make sure you could do the weekly problem sets (perhaps with a bit of inspiration, and a bit of help from the excellent ta.)  make no mistake about it, the problem sets were long and difficult, as you might expect for a 3000-level course in qm, and he began writing them himself to discourage use of the answer key for the book. in effect though, this actually made the problem sets easier since he could teach directly to what would be on the problem sets.\nherman frequently criticized the book for being too elegant. perhaps. i thought the book, both chapters and problems were quite well-written and insightful, allowing me to gain a more complete understanding of qm and filling in gaps of stuff i didn't quite understand in the lectures. griffiths is a great author (both in e&m and in quantum.) nonetheless, the book problems were often extremely difficult to complete without the answer key. the problems herman wrote himself were more manageable. the main legitimate criticism and difficulty was that the book often relegated key pieces of information to the problems themselves, requiring insights that i was not capable of producing with any sort of frequency (perhaps some higher physics talents might be able to do so.) herman tried to supplement the book by going over certain concepts in more detail, and i think he did so effectively.\nthe test were very manageable, albeit a bit long. the distribution for these was highly bimodal though, with half the class scoring above 70 and the other half scoring below 50. what the tests did well is test your conceptual understanding of qm, and not if you could evaluate random tricky integrals and make unusual or tricky connections. it seemed to me that if you kept up with the work, the curve was quite forgiving, but if you didn't you were crushed.\noverall i was pleasantly surprised with prof. herman. he is no doubt an intelligent and capable professor. i had him for physics of the human body as well, and i often had difficulty following him in that class (given i was a freshman.) if you like physics or qm at all, you will enjoy this class. it was my favorite class this semester, and i actually wished we had forayed a bit further into the material (the first time i've ever felt that in a class- we only covered chapters 1-4 in griffiths, about the first ~250 pages), but i suppose that's what next semester is for. my main remaining gripe with him is that he is not very approachable. the ta, austin, made up for that almost entirely though.", "he told us on the first day that it was the first time he had taught this course and used this text. boy did it show. herman is a great administrator, okay scientist (check out the number of citations he has using google scholar; pretty low for a columbia professor; not to say that i have any myself) but worst of all, a mediocre professor. i learned absolutely nothing in this class.\nherman's lectures are all over the board. literally. he will go on and on about something that is in the text, griffith's \"introduction to quantum mechanics,\" or attempt to do relatively simple derivation but do nothing except confuse you. if you want the low down read the book. going to lecture did absolutely nothing for me in this class and i hardly missed one.\nthe homeworks are difficult, usually encompassing something we haven't covered or done. most students in the class have seen qm before; i had not. i was far behind the entire time. just as an example of divide in the class, on the midterm, 4 people essentially failed, 6 got \"bs\" (50t fall into the habit of using the solutions manual.", "i thought herman was a good professor.  he moves quickly in lecture but is thorough and answers all questions thrown his way.  goes through proofs extensively but doesn't do a whole lot of problem solving in class, making the problem sets more difficult.  he doesn't like the textbook we used and i tend to agree, it skips a lot of material and leaves it to the homework problems.  the problem sets are hard and time consuming, and there is one every week no exceptions.  he wouldn't give out a practice/past midterm or final, making the type of questions on them kind of a mystery.  but they really aren't as bad as the problem sets and lectures would lead you to expect.  pretty much the basic concepts in short problems. overall a challenging class, not worth taking as a tech elective (whoops) but a good class.", "i would not recommend taking this course as a junior!!! heed this warning!!!\neverything about this class seems wrong, and yet they allow it to be taught in the department. for starters, quantum i and quantum ii topics are mashed into one semester. he requires attendance, but he flys through material, proofs, and derivations leaving nothing to be learned. the book is ponderous to say the least; it could bore a rock. i would suggest high taking this course as a graduate student, unless you are in applied physics in which case you should take this your senior year coupled with a lot of easier 3000 level classes, or some less demanding 4000 level classes.", "this professor goes through thirteen out of sixteen chapters in the textbook...tell me, which professor goes through nearly an entire textbook in quantum physics? by the end, there is so much material, it is impossible for undergraduates to master everything. to give you an idea of how much time he probably would have wanted you to devote to this class: half the problems in the homework sets are \"extra\" problems that undergrads don't do (and graduate students should do because this class is almost catered to them) that used to be required but herman made them optional because people were complaining about the insanity of the length of the homeworks. it probably wouldn't be as bad if he actually tried to make us understand the material, which he does but unsuccessfully. so you be the judge: poor pedagogy, biblical amounts of work, and it's quantum physics.", "i haven't finished this class but i felt like i should write a review before people picked their classes for next semester because the other reviews seemed a bit misleading to me. the fact that he gives open-book tests, along with the fact that his lectures are straight from the book (even down to the anecdotes, no joke, even the stories he tells are straight from the book) make it seem like the class will be relatively easy. the problem is, while herman is a very smart guy, he is terrible at explaining things which is reflected in his lectures as well as the book he wrote, currently a work-in-progress that is full of parenthetical notes-to-self. honestly the material he presents is not overly difficult, but it's nearly impossible to sift through the dense lectures and books to figure out exactly what he is asking you or teaching you. the book is 750 pages long full of long paragraphs with examples embedded in the text which very often make very little sense as he will introduce obscure variables in one chapter and then reference them again in equations with no explanation several chapters later. the organization of the book makes it difficult to find anything and a huge process to figure out what he's saying. herman has done his research and constructed a lot of interesting mechanical models for the processes of the human body, but i can't help feeling that he could benefit hugely from a co-author to make his book even remotely readable and/\nor comprehensible. i wouldn't take this class unless you're hugely interested in the subject matter and willing to spend a lot of frustrating time decoding his book. one thing i will say is that the ta is excellent and truly understands the plight of students trying to understand what herman is getting at.", "prof. herman is certainly a nice guy. and yes, he is funny in a corny kind of way. but that doesn't make him a particularly good teacher. there is way too much material in the \"textbook\" (his typed up notes), and the hws don't always follow directly from the notes. the tests aren't very enjoyable either, despite being open book. the classes consist of prof herman basically going word for word through the notes, interspersed with corny jokes and anecdotes. i did get the impression that he expected you to know things before taking the class, which isn't exactly fair, given that it's an intro class. he also seemed somewhat difficult to get a hold of outside of class; he didn't even have scheduled office hours. oh, and regardless of how pointless it may seem to go to lectures, don't skip classes: he counts that against your grade. the material itself can be fairly interesting; it's just not presented in the best way. if you really like physics, and don't mind trying to teach yourself things, i guess you'd probably love this class.", "there is no doubt that herman is incredibly intelligent.  unfortunately, he possesses none of the qualities a good professor has.  he is not approachable in that he expects you to understand certain things before taking his class.  he will make you feel stupid, not on purpose, but rather because he thinks what you're saying is stupid.  he also thinks that quantum is the only course his students take during a semester, and that they should devote all their time to the class.  the amount of background studying required for this class is far beyond what any undergrad with more than 12 credits can handle.  finally, he lectures for himself and for the grad students.   he does not concern himself with the stragglers (undergrads) in the class, and races through the material to maximize material covered rather than maximize understanding.  do not take this course as an undergrad!", "prof. herman is a really good teacher.  even if you don't think you learned a lot in his class, you'll still end up applying the things you learned in class to what happens to you in real life.  the workload is pretty easy, except you should expect to get confused when trying to figure out which units to use for problem sets.  the midterm and final are open book and notes.  he is a funny guy, and his lectures are for the most part engaging.", "this guys is awesome. the book is useless, but he types out class notes and hands them out for every chapter before going over it. it is still a must to go to class however, because it can be very hard to understand the notes without seeing the lecture. lectures can be hillarious when herman tells stories. you'll end up thinking about material from the class in everyday life, which is cool. the problem sets vary from difficult to moderately easy, and are due every other week."], "summary": ["The professor\u2019s class is difficult, but rewarding. He is good at explaining difficult concepts, but still his assignments require a lot of work: the homework is long and difficult. Unlike the homework, the tests are manageable.

worth it.\np.s. do as much of the readings as you can - especially the primary sources, which are really, really interesting. however, he and the tas are all understanding and sometimes don't even expect you to have read all of it. do the readings because they will enhance your appreciation of the material.", "this is the best class i'll probably ever take while in college. every glowing review on here is true and encapsulates the class perfectly.\nhowever, i want to address the review that says the class is focused on white cis gay men because if this was true i wouldn't have taken the class and i don't want that false statement to dissuade anyone. despite being limited by sources and research favoring white men, chauncey goes to great lengths to make his class disrupt the narrative of the exclusively white gay man. we learned in-depth about both gay men and lesbians and the queer community among people of color. queer men and women of color were never tokenized or mentioned briefly, but woven fully in the narrative of queer history.\nin terms of \"first mentioning transphobia by name in the last week of class\": you could only think this if you did not attend a lecture or fundamentally misunderstood the course. transphobia wasn't mentioned until the end because \"transgender\" is a very recent term, and the class started in the 1700s. however, questions of gender identity was a central theme of the course from the start. in fact, much of what we covered revolved around people who today might be called trans because they were the face of the queer community when sexuality hardly a concept.\nin short, this class is highly intersectional (as other reviewers state as well). if you're tired of the lack of representation in queer narratives, please take this course.", "professor chauncey is fantastic. i took the course during fall 2020, so the entire course was virtual, but because he put so much thought and effort into the class experience, it was by far the best class i took this semester. lectures are twice a week - they are fascinating, funny, and engaging, but they are dense. section meets once a week to discuss the readings. the course is a must-take no matter your sexual orientation -- everyone will learn something from this class.\nhe tries to make this class approachable for non-history majors, and i know that many of the students in the class were not history majors, but it is definitely not easy. there is a ton of material to learn, so don't underestimate it. despite that, i gained so much from this class, and if you are willing to put in the effort, it is so incredibly worth it.", "take this class!!! i cannot say how grateful i am for having taken this class my first year of college. as a straight student who had been literally ignorant about some central lgbtq debates, i have learned so much from this class about lgbtq history, changes in our pop culture, feminism, gender issues, and so much more.\nthis is a class that really made me rethink my presumptions and start looking at the surrounding world more intentionally. lectures are very engaging and well-organized, and professor chauncey is a very approachable person. he replies to emails promptly and genuinely cares about his students. i walked away from this class with so much gratitude.", "pretty sure the first time professor chauncey mentioned transphobia by name was in last week of class.  the focus of this class is definitely on white cis gay men, so be warned.  you're probably better off taking a gender/sexuality studies class.", "based on these reviews, it is really a tragedy that chauncey isn't gold-verified yet. everything everybody else has said is true, but i will just add that prof. chauncey is probably the closest thing you could get to a robin williams-esque college professor. he is by far the best lecturer i have had in college (and i am a history major, so i've had some great lecturers!). he made me believe the lecture model actually can be a valuable learning tool.\nbut beyond even that, i have never had a professor care so demonstrably about their students in such a big class. chauncey cried in front of us at least three times. when talking about sensitive, traumatic moments in lgbt history, he told us constantly we were precious both to him and the world. he really creates an atmosphere of radical vulnerability while also offering an impeccably researched, structured class. i missed only one lecture and i still regret it.\ni recommend us lesbian & gay history to everyone who asks me for life-changing, off-the-wall class suggestions. you will benefit so much from it if you are gay, especially because chauncey takes such pains to weave in the history of columbia/barnard into general queer history. but! you also will benefit from it just if you want a fun class. for history major prospies also, it's a really excellent introduction to contemporary historical research methods and a great alternative to a basic intro euro survey.", "take this class if you are even remotely considering it. chauncey is an incredible professor and lecturer who truly cares about his students. his lecture style is very engaging and felt more like a podcast i was super interested in than having to sit through a round of slides. if you are a history major, i 100% recommend this class for you. we did oral history, wrote papers, and went over extremely interesting material. not only is the material interesting but the professor is incredible as well. i wish i could take this class every semester.\nhowever, this class has really helped me establish my desire to be a history major, and learn about us history through a new fresh context. if there is any advice i could give to incoming students who are wondering what to take, it is to take this class at some point in your college career! even if you aren't lgbt, it is so interesting and such important material. nothing but glowing reviews!!!", "this is the best class ever taught by the best professor ever with the best tas ever. i have nothing negative to say about this class. i'm serious. the worst thing about u.s. lesbian and gay history is that it ends. when the semester is over, you will wish it wasn't.\ngeorge chauncey is a rare gem. not only is he an expert in the field of u.s. gay and lesbian history, but he is also an incredibly engaging and compelling lecturer. his passion for the subject shines through in every class and he is an excellent speaker. one thing that struck me about professor chauncey was his fair and unbias presentation of information. he said on the first day of class that he would teach us about the history of the anti-gay movement, but would never bash or mock the anti-gay movement. because of his fairness, i feel like i walked away with a deeper understanding of anti-gay ideology in american than i would have if he had mocked them or made it seem like they were stupid. professor chauncey is kind, funny, entertaining, and incredibly intelligent. there was never a dull moment. an insider tip: make sure you ask your tas about chauncey's work. he was involved first hand in many of the movements he discusses in class but rarely talks about his own involvement. my ta told our discussion section a little bit more about chauncey's personal work in the field and all i can say is, what an incredible guy!\nspeaking of the tas, my ta for this class, nikita shepard, was wonderful. they were knowledgeable and passionate about gay u.s. history. we had the best time ever in our discussion section. the seniors in my disc section all said that nikita was the best ta they had ever had. in addition to presenting the information in the readings to us in a concise, helpful way, they also made an effort to include information about trans people and people of color within the queer movement, as did chauncey himself. as another reviewer mentioned, this class is not whitewashed by any means, nor does it skip over trans history. i am confident that chauncey and the tas will continue to talk about queer people of color and trans people even more as more research is done.\ntake this class. as a queer person, it will make you think about your identity in a way you never have before. think you know gay history? i promise you don't.", "chauncey is great. this class was really wonderful to take -- sometimes i cried in class because of the powerful nature of the lectures, sometimes i laughed so hard because of how funny chauncey is... great class. his midterm and final were kind of intense, but the tas graded fairly. there are a fair amount of readings and you have to do them to succeed in discussion section or the tests. the two essays weren't impossible either. i really recommend this if you're queer (or straight) because you learn a lot about your history that you'll have never known!", "professor chauncey is a great great great professor who has taught me so much about the history of queer/lgbt+ activism and identity in america. lectures are always really well organized and he provides a lot of detail about queer life since the 1800s. his own research focuses mostly on gay culture in new york city (which he literally wrote a book about), and he is always happy to talk to students outside of class. he is genuinely excited about his field and the work he does, and really hopes to get students excited about queer history as well. readings are very very interesting, and the assignments really are intended to get you to think about how your personal experiences reflect broader ideas about queer identity in the world around you. the class is called \"lesbian and gay history\" not because prof. chauncey excludes trans issues from his research, but because he recognizes that his own research has focused predominantly on specifically gay and lesbian issues, and doesn't want to misrepresent the content of the course. he is a white cis-gender man with his blind spots, but he does his best to bring in histories about communities of colour (his work actually talks a lot about puerto rican gay communities in nyc) and gender non-conformity. he's also pretty knowledgeable about gay politics in different countries, which he's happy to talk about during office hours. i don't know if its possible to overstate his importance in the field of queer history - his book, gay new york, was the second major historical publication about queer identity after john d'emilio, and he was the historian \"on call\" when they were trying to pass marriage equality in 2015, and testified for ~8 hours on the stand about the history of anti-gay discrimination in the united states. regardless of all these academic qualifications, you should take this class because he's incredibly down to earth and a genuinely kind person who invests a great deal of his own emotional energies into his teaching. he talks a lot about his personal experiences as a gay man in america during lecture, and the last few classes towards the end of the semester get very emotionally intense when the content moves towards stuff like aids and the rise of the christian right in america. he cares deeply about his students and wants us to all take care of ourselves and each other.\nthe only thing i will say is that lectures can be a little dry at times, even though he tries his best to insert ~millennial~ references for our benefit.", "this class is so incredible. and you do not need to be gay to take it. chauncey is probably the best lecturer you will ever have. incredibly organized, passionate, and more than anything else, fun. he spiced up lectures by playing fun music, showing movie clips, and doing basically all of the things that a professor should do. he made me cry and laugh uncovered a whole world of history that i did not know about before. take this class!!!!", "the most engaging lecturer i've ever had. this class is engaging and beautiful, so special. take this class. chancey is a gem of a teacher. so grateful this class exists.", "i don't even know where to begin with professor chauncey... i'll start by saying that i have never written a culpa review, but i knew it would be an injustice for me not to do so for this class. professor chauncey just came with his husband to columbia from yale, which is probably why you hadn't heard much of him before. when he taught this class at yale, it was so large that he had 15 ta's, so that should tell you something about it to begin with.\nin regard to the class itself, i will say that this is by far my favorite class at columbia (and i am a senior). each of the lectures is incredibly interesting and engaging, and you will learn so many things that you probably knew nothing about or took for granted in the past. chauncey is at once brilliant, compassionate, and funny. he is cited in almost all of the books he assigns (because he is one of the best in his field), but he is not at all pretentious. he goes out of his way to meet as many of his students as possible, and even offers to meet them for coffee or lunch. one day, he came into our section to observe how the ta's were doing (which i have literally never seen a professor do at this school), and by the end he successfully went around and named everyone in the class.\ni also feel it is important to add that this class is not as white-washed or as dismissive of queer/trans identities than its title or description may suggest. chauncey says from the day one that he makes it a priority to incorporate the stories and histories of queer people of color into the narrative (and he is currently writing a book that aims to do this in the context of new york city), and he does a good job of sticking to this throughout the semester (unlike other professors whose efforts to include poc into their curriculum are tokenized or minimal). as for trans identities, you will quickly learn that this is an integral part of the course, but that it is simply the words that change throughout history. for example, you will learn that at one point, people assumed gay men or women to be gender inverts.\nthis is all to say that professor chauncey's class is a must-take at columbia. this is history that everyone should know something about -- whether or not you identity as queer or trans. chauncey is taking a year off to finish writing his book about queer life in nyc, but when he comes back and teaches this course in fall 2019, take it."], "summary": ["The professor is great, and the

chemistry.\nthe course\nthe ta was fantastic and he is very responsive via email as well as in office hours. the labs were graded harshly but very fairly. i find it most perplexing. so sticking to the course manual guidelines was critical. the take-home quizzes were challenging as you would be asked to read scientific literature and use it substantiate your claims/findings in the lab experiment. the in-class quizzes were difficult- perhaps the most challenging. this kind of made the difference between what grade you made the course if you were on the brink. the in-class quizzes wee basically a new experiment from a research article that related to the experiment we completed that week. you had to understand the context of the experiment and answer questions under a time limit. so without knowing the general concepts of the experiment and applying them would make the quiz all the more difficult. although you may not get a good yield, but a yield is expected as this makes it all the more challenging to explain your data. i should also add that yield is not a criterion used for grading. the lab reports are strictly graded based on the rubric.\noverall\nthe course was fantastic! i would probably do it again :) we learned so much more chemistry and i thought this was an invaluable experience whether you are going into phd or md or both.", "to begin with, fay is a great person.

complex. that being said, for the love of god, do not take this class.\nit is a general rule with stem labs that you won't be getting much (if anything at all) from the work you do in the course. we all know it, the tas know it and the professors know it. fay did not seem to get that memo. intensive organic chem lab is basically a lot of work with no return whatsoever. her lectures and the instruction manual covered the basics of the material covered. but for the quizzes, post-labs and lab reports, you had to know how to apply all these concepts that she covered theoretically. fay is a great lecturer and if you go to office hours it becomes apparent that she can explain everything to you. if you can't go to office hours though, you're kinda fucked. i had to teach myself how to interpret nmr spectra (and even if you think you know how to do that from orgo lectures, trust me, you don't) and how to write a \"proper\" chemistry paper. the grading is also insanely nitpicky -- the average on the quizzes and post-labs never got above 12/15, and you could lose points on the most insignificant aspects (defining one peak, out of your 10!, as a multiplet instead of as a doublet of doublets). the worst part? i still need to google \"ir absorption table\" or look up the chemdraw structure of molecules to be able to figure out their spectra. one would assume that putting in over 10 hours of work on each lab report (and some of the post-labs!!!) would result in some sort of lasting knowledge. one would, however, be mistaken.\nvery rarely is it possible to directly pinpoint the source of all your anxiety and suffering. for me, this was intensive organic chemistry lab.", "pre-requisite: intro orgo lab - it is assumed you are familiar with organic chemistry

follows the same format as intensive ochem lab. read the experiment and prepare your pre-lab notebook before class. in the beginning of class fay lectures about the experiment to be conducted that day. if its the last day of an experiment, a quiz will be given before going to lab. in lab you carry out the experiment. these experiments alternate between short (2-3 class periods) and long (3-4 class periods). some days you may finish very quickly. others you may have to wait a while as the reaction is carried out. you will be assigned a lab partner whom you will work with for the duration of the semester (each has to do an individual lab report). all labs work smoothly for the most part. lab reports require you to think critically and read source articles in order to explain the results you obtained. this class is great for many reasons including: getting into the habit of reading academic journals, writing in an academic manner about experiments conducted, conducting cool experiments in areas of chemistry not usually touched upon in intro ochem courses (molecular sensors, chiral resolution/asymmetric synthesis, metal organic frameworks, material chemistry/photovoltaics).\nprofessor fay ng: fay is such a great professor. her lectures are succinct and help clear up any questions you may have about the experiment. she is very approachable in office hours/ class and makes an effort to get to know her students personally, taking an interest in their activities outside of class. she started this class a while back and you can see the effort put into refining it over the years as the experiments actually work and allow you to develop/strengthen ochem lab techniques. by the end of the class, i felt more confident in my ability to work in a  lab environment, my understanding of the subject matters, and my writing abilities. i feel very fortunate to have had her for a full year of lab and can highly recommend any of her classes to my

feel like as long as you stuck to those, you were great. i read some reviews saying that the quizzes were the most difficult part of the course. that is probably true, because it is really the only part of the class where you are graded on your knowledge of the chemistry involved in each experiment. if you are stuck on just what you are doing in the experiment, you won't excel, you need to truly understand the chemistry involved, and its significance to the world of synthetic or analytic organic chemistry. that being said, i learned a ton of new chemistry and lab technique. the reactions you are doing are pretty new, and involve some pretty expensive reagents/equipment which is also great, and great experience.  fay is awesome and interested in each of her students, their futures, and their own personal interests. i enjoyed every moment of the class, never was stressed and received an a-. fay rules.", "i have to disagree with the reviewer below by saying that fay's lab class is actually one of the easiest courses you'll take at columbia (easier than the regular orgo lab class, from what i've heard).  because you are not graded on the content of your lab reports (i.e. your accidental experiments), you won't be punished for getting a poor yield or no product at all.  in fact, a poor yield is very easy to write about so often those lab reports were the easiest to do.\nthe only really challenging part of the class, in my opinion, was the quizzes.  but those don't count for much in the grand scheme of things, so i would definitely recommend this class to any chem or biochem major.  it's an easy, nonstressful class where an a is not unattainable.", "yes, it's an advanced science course, but if you're a biochemistry major who needs to fulfill a lab requirement, this is a great way to do it.  sure, it's hard; this was the hardest class i've ever taken at columbia to date, but it was also the most enjoyable.  there are 4 multi-day labs over the course of the semester.  in spring 2011, they were catalytic asymmetric synthesis, organic polymers, combinatiorial chemistry and supramolecular chemsitry.  none of the topics are covered in any sort of depth in regular organic lectures, so you will be learning something new every class.  that said, the lab reports and quizzes are hard.  the short ones are 6-8 pages and the long ones are 7-10.  they're graded fairly, and there is a curve at the end.  you have to be willing to teach yourself a lot of chemistry from journal articles, since that's really the only way to do the lab reports.  the journal of chemical education will become your best friend.\nfay is probably my favorite teacher here at columbia.  she explains everything well, and will help you whenever you need it.  she'd talk with us at

tests, you really do need to know the material and especially minute details because he asks about those often. i didn't think he was a bad prof, but he's not necessarily great.", "disclaimer: i did okay in the class so i have no reason to write a biased review.\nfriesner is a pretty shitty lecturer. as a matter of fact he reads right off his slides which makes going to class kind of pointless. his exams tend to contain awkwardly worded questions which at times make you feel like you're being tested on comprehension rather than the material itself. also, his ta this year loved making ridiculously tough quizzes. he was a really nice guy but i think he expected a little too much out of someone who was encountering the material for an intro level course. that being said, if you are a self studier and one of those people who can read the book and show up for exams, this class may not be as bad for you. the curve tends to be nicer since his exams averages are pretty low compared to other chem sections. some of his exam questions are directly off the slides so definitely read the slides after reading the textbook. overall, i would say take this class if you are a good independent studier and not if you learn the most from going to lecture.", "this class was interesting and very lenient in terms of homework. unfortunately, and i am not exaggerating, you will have to teach yourself the material by reading the book and working on the homework assignments (which are not collected). going to lecture is optional, for the most part. professor friesner provides an overview of each chapter and drops hints about what will or will not be tested.\nlectures are, in a way, an overview of what you should have taught yourself. you cannot expect to learn the material at the lecture

formulas that i was tested on were literally only mentioned once in lecture and recitation. the best way to succeed is to learn what kinds of computational problems you'll be tested on (usually assigned in the homework) and drill them in all their permutations. after you get good at them, the computational problems will be money in the bank for exams. for the conceptual parts, read the chapter early and let the concepts roll around in your head as you do the homework. don't be afraid to use youtube and khan for some additional help.\nrecitation was the worst part of my week. right off the bat, you have a 15 minute quiz, most of which are super stressful. the remaining 45 mins were simply not enough for the ta to review all of the lecture material. the quizzes can be soul crushing, even if you studied hard. my class average, across all of them, was somewhere around a 65. even though i knew there would be a curve, i definitely had a few long walks home after getting wrecked on a quiz. expect it, it will happen to you.\ni would only recommend taking gen chem with prof friesner if you're a certified self starter. you'll have to teach yourself the course, flat out. i never went to office hours or attended a study group and got an a-. just be aware that the material is highly conceptual and you'll have to know the formulas and concepts like the back of your hand.", "i feel obligated to write a review for professor friesner, because i think he does get a bad reputation from all of the other culpa reviews below. friesner is a good guy, but a bad professor. however, that is not to say that it is impossible to get a good grade in his class. although he teaches straight out of his slides, be aware that his slides are based off of the zumdahl book and that his exams are based off of his slides. so therefore, his exams are straight out of the book. i went to maybe 50% of the lectures, and got an a+ in that class. the easiest way to do well in his class is to read the book at the same pace as he teaches. the zumdahl book is straightforward, and so are his exams. as long as you read, you'll do fine. also, the tas are extremely helpful, because they know that friesner doesn't do a good job of teaching such simple topics (he often goes on ridiculous tangents into really advanced chemistry), so go to office hours and recitations, because they will help.\nfriesner posts practice exams with answer keys before each midterm, and posts the actual midterms with your answers after each test. he is very generous with giving back points, so argue for your points!\nalso, know that he is teaching gen chem i, which means that there are a lot of people who think that they're going to be pre-med, but can't handle the workload in that class, creating an extremely generous curve.\nhe's a good guy, bad teacher. but by the end of the course, if you put in the effort, your grade will be an accurate reflection of how much chemistry you learn.", "horrible, but fair, professor.  his lectures suck, point blank.  contrary to what another reviewer said, his slides are his own, or at least edited by him, even though they say the book name at the bottom.  he reads straight from the slides and seems condescending when he answers questions (even though i don't think he means to).  he actually does care that we learn from him even though we are undergrads, even though it doesn't seem like it at first.  go to the ta's office hours if you need help; they are useful.\nall his slides including his exam review slides are posted online.  study them and read the book, and you'll be golden.  the only reason to show up to lecture is that he'll tell you what won't be on the exam that is in the reading/he accidentally left in the slides.\ndefinitely, definitely read the book!!!!\nfair grader, fair exams.  average is usually low, so curve is generous.\ncan't say that you shouldn't take this class, because he is fair.  if you read the book, you'll learn the material, and his slides are stellar imo.", "it would be unmerited to characterize what happens in friesner's lectures as \"teaching.\" he simply reads verbatim from the extremely elementary powerpoint slides that he has managed to throw together.\nthese same slides are always posted on courseworks, so by the third or fourth lecture,  most people eliminate the middle man, read the slides themselves, and stop wasting time at his classes considering that they are simply an opportunity for friesner to recite the information to you.\nunfortunately, most of what's covered during the semester will essentially need to be self-taught, which is no small task considering the complexity and the inherently confusing nature of the material.\nneedless to say, the best part about this chemistry class for me was when it came to a conclusion.", "this professor was useless.  professor friesner, or as we call him \"ricky bob friesner,\" is completely uninterested in undergrads and really couldn't give a rat's ass about us.  i heard that he is a millionaire because of some huge discovery he made, and is a major hot shot in the field, and an incredible researcher, whatever.  but no man can be perfect.  in friesner's case, he fails completely at teaching.\nhis lectures are ridiculously boring, he only reads the slides that came with our textbook (unaltered).  think that having a well-known professor will add value to your class?  think again.  i could have learned more by reading through the slides myself for an hour and 15 minutes.\nbecause of this, i stopped going to lectures right around the beginning of october.  chem was much better after that, i just read the book before midterms and managed to get through the course putting no more than 6 hours (total, including study time) of work between the beginning of october and the end of the semester.  i didn't get a great grade, but it was worth it.\nof course, ricky bob friesner still gets a chance to fuck with us on the tests.  on the first midterm, i got an uncurved 22/25.  then, two and a half weeks later, they emailed us to say that they were changing the answers to the midterm.  they switched the answer to one question, and not only added points to people who got the new correct answer, but removed points from people (like me) who got the old correct answer!  the craziest thing is that one of the answers was correct in the textbook, and the other was correct in friesner's lectures--so i got points taken away 2.5 weeks later for putting down the answer that our textbook listed.  wicked, bro.\ndon't bother taking this class with friesner.  or, if you do, just don't come to lecture at least.", "this was a very fair class.  the lectures were not particularly interesting, as friesner essentially read off his slides.  occasionally, he offered some extra information but the tests did not contain any material outside of the powerpoints and the textbook.  the midterms were very fair.  most of the material is covered in the powerpoints and the review before the midterms (25 mcq) covers a lot of the topics that will be on the midterm.  the questions on the midterm were sometimes quite annoying (lots of which one of these is not true) but they were doable if you studied well.  the recitation was also very fair.  my ta was not an exceptional teacher but he did a fair job.  overall, this class was fairly easy.  you don't need to go to lectures to do well (i stopped going after the first three weeks).  just self-study and look at the powerpoints.\nmidterm one: class average: 70-75\nmidterm two: class average: ~65\nmidterm three: class average: 70-75\none midterm is dropped and there are 7-8 recitation quizzes (2 dropped; average of quiz grades is equivalent to another midterm). midterms are 20 percent each\nfinal is 50 questions and counts for 40 percent.  the class is curved ridiculously.  the class average is curved to a b and one standard deviation above is an a.  for those who have previous chemistry experience, an a is not very hard to obtain.", "this class is extremely boring. friesner only reads off the slides that are basically like reading the book. i went to the first 3 weeks of class then stopped going altogether. he does post exam review power points that say, for the most part, what you need to study. i personally do not enjoy his exams, there's a lot of theory based questions and you really need to understand to subject to get them. he also words them weird:\n\"which of the following is not correct?\"\nwhich pisses me off because i don't understand why he can't just say \"false\" -.-\nthe curve is really nice, which i did like about it. there are three exams, one of which is dropped. the final is fair, and i thought was relatively easy once you've taken all the other tests.\nwe definitely need more passionate and class-engaging chem. professors at columbia. if you're taking this course, i recommend going with parkin, everyone seems to enjoy him much better.", "please do not take this class, the lectures are absolutely pointless and he seems to not care at all about teaching gen chem. get out of the class when you can. do not think because you took ap chem or something to that extent this is an easy a, not at all. everything, especially his tests, are highly conceptual and even though the tests are multiple choice, its paragraph multiple choice where you legit have to read it three times just to figure out what it's saying. the only perk in this class is that the average tends to be low, so beat the curve, do the practice exams and read the textbook, and read the textbook again.", "i love professor freisner and completely disagree with these negative reviews. he is 110% fair and approachable. he is always willing to help during office hours and the course is very interesting. it is not an easy class, but if you work hard there is absolutely no reason why you shouldn't do well. i would definitely recommend this class, professor freisner is the cutest! although it is tough material, any gen chem class will be just as demanding so you're better off doing it with freisner. freisner gives reviews before every exam and is pretty vocal about what he finds to be important (and will usually test on the things he points out).", "i wasn't going to write a review until i saw the other very negative reviews on professor friesner. the class was very challenging in that you had to completely teach yourself the material from the textbook. the lectures themselves were really boring and simply consisted of watching him read the material on his slides back to us for an hour and a half. i wouldn't blame this so much on friesner as on the class in general, as it seemed that people in other classes seemed to be having just as hard a time with their professors. needless to say, the lectures are pretty useless. i didn't go to lectures very much at all after the first midterm and i ended up doing very well. if you are able to teach yourself (which shouldn't be hard because most of the material is very straightforward) then the class should be no problem at all. friesner himself is very helpful if you go to office hours and he always has a review day the lecture before the test during which he essentially tells you everything that you need to study. if you study the review slides, do the homework (and actually attempt to understand it) and read the textbook then you'll do fine.\ni would definitely also recommend getting the solutions manual that comes with the textbook because when test time comes you're probably going to have to do a lot of practice problems to understand things, and if you have the solutions manual it saves you the time you would have had to spent going to ta office hours to get the answers.\noverall, i would definitely recommend taking friesner's class, it's very fair and he's very willing to help students understand the material. but keep in mind that no matter what genchem class you take, you're going to have to work hard to get a good grade.", "coming from an entire family of chem professors, i spent the winter break talking to them about my gen chem i experience. apparently, it is very unusual for a senior professor to be teaching two sections of gen chem.  gen chem is usually a subject that takes a lot of work and time to teach, is boring, and normally not fulfilling as many are uncaring freshman. that being said, the reason friesner is teaching two sections of gen chem is probably because his research has tanked and he has nothing else to do with his time. this would explain why he was grumpy, impersonal, would not write his own lecture material, did not like teaching, etc. bottom line: do not take his class...he was the worst of the 4 gen chem professors this semester. avoid at all costs.\nhis ta's however, were generally helpful.", "i would highly recommend taking professor friesner's class. he is fair and approachable. if you attend class regularly, complete the homework and study from his lecture notes, you will be well prepared for his exams. he provides you with all the resources to do well. in fact, in disagreement with some of the other negative reviews, professor friesner makes it very clear that he wants his students to do well and to master the material. the first exam is extremely challenging, most likely because professor friesner's exams are far different from the average science exam. his questions are demanding, especially conceptually and qualitatively. his evaluations really do demonstrate whether or not you have mastered the material. if you are having trouble grasping concepts, i would highly suggest that you go to his office hours-they are very helpful.", "professor friesner is a terribly ineffective teacher. the slides come straight out of the textbook and by the end of the semester nobody even bothers to go to the lectures.\ni had a serious problem with the tests in that they were hard to score well on. he uses \"which one of these is not true?\" questions way too much for 25-multiple choice tests and you end up getting frustrated, even though you know about the material than what is reflected in your grade. you'll slap yourself for getting those questions wrong, but what can you do? the most effective thing to do, sadly, is to study yourself. study with friends who have him and pay close attention to courseworks where review material is hiding- the ta's, collectively, are helpful. the review sessions are so-so, i recommend office hours if you don't get one particular topic rather than sitting through an hour of \"water sticks to things, and itself!\"\npick someone else.", "beware. dr. friesner (df) obviously hates teaching undergrads. apparently he is an impressive researcher - overheard some students talking about how he is \"the sh*t\" but that does not apply to his teaching abilities. his \"lectures\" consisted of him reading off slides which he ripped right out of the textbook. every 4 or 5 words in his lecture, he never fails to interject with his hacking cough. his pronunciation also leaves much to be desired - he managed to mutilate \"schrodinger\" into \"shroner.\"\nthe best part about df was the way he told us to disregard the way the textbook broke the octet rule for lewis dot structures, since *according to his research*, hyperconjugation wth formal charges was a more accurate method. so if you are the type who wants to learn about cutting edge results from quantum chemistry research in an intro class, df might be the one for you.\ni learned absolutely nothing from df's lectures and was forced to learn the material on my own from the book and the tas (nicholas anderson and sy redding were both extremely competent and helpful.)\ni'm not sure you could do better than df in columbia's chemistry department though. we had a professor who was teaching another section of 1403 (valentini, i believe) substitute for df once. he wasn't much better.", "before i chose classes for the first time i did not think that the teacher i had would affect the type of education or grade i recieved because i had the belief that simple hard work and self reliance would be all i needed to do well.  this is not the case in friesner's classes.  as many others before me have written, he seems genuinely disinterested in teaching and takes every opportunity to remind you that you are in gen. chem and thus will not go into as much detail as he would like.  that being said, he goes into extreme detail in his notes that do show up on the test, but it is not laid out in a clear enough fashion to completely comprehend.  his tests are extremely hard and wordy, which is shown in the average test grades of 17/25 for each test.  all of the slides he shows in class are read in an extremely monotonous voice verbatum with no explanation given.  people are allowed to ask questions, but more often than not after his garbled and jargon riddled answers you will end up more confused.  i had a great ta though who clarified a lot for me.  it is extremely important to read the text book and to stay on top of the material otherwise going to class will be even harder since you will not have any idea as to what is going on.  in friesner's defence, he does have a review session before every test and goes over what will be covered.  also, he did say the average grade in the class would be a b, so i guess if the whole class does poorly it is possible to do somewhat decently.", "horrible teacher.  he reads slides that he got from the company that wrote the textbook with a monotone voice with most of the lights out in the lecture room.  basically, you end up falling asleep.  some of the tas are okay.  i had a good one but didn't learn enough from him to do well.  studying on your own for this course is very helpful (the book is quite good) and if you do you should get a great grade.  take valentini, he is easier.  nobody attends friesner's class and those who do just browse the internet during class.  friesner is not only an incompetent teacher he also seems to dislike teaching.", "take parkins if you can. this guy just reads confusing slides that he probably got from the internet. he's useless. the slides are bad, as they try to digest everything into a few words to fit on the slide, which simply ends up being tough to understand. you might as well read the book by yourself. tas, at least as i've learned from mine and from friends' are stupid. they don't really care about you and just quiz you.\nif this is an ivy league school, why cant they get good teachers? fuh, my high school teachers were better than the majority here", "freisner is very unfriendly towards students. he is extremely rude in person and doesn't really care about his students.\nsome of the tas are also extremely bad and they don't know what is going on as they never show up for lectures. the quizzes differ in their difficulty so choosing the right ta will give you a better grade in the class. the tas also do not communicate with each other or the professor, so don't expect to ask them anything logistical about the class. you go to recitations to take the quiz and that's basically it. no time for anything else.\njust because they're your ta doesn't mean they know more than you. keep this in mind.\nlectures are completely useless. the book, however, is golden.", "he sucks!!!  his powerpoints are straight off the text book and he doesn't really explain anything.

sure you pick a good ta.", "friesner is unfriendly towards students and clearly dislikes teaching and showing up to class everyday. if you end up taking this class i would recommend viewing his slides online, reading the book, and skipping the lectures.", "i highly recommend friesner if you plan to go to class and read the textbook. if you do both these things seriously, there is no reason not to get an a. he puts his notes on the blackboard....copy these down word for word, because a couple questions on each test come from these notes. some say that the only class you need to attend is right before the exam, where he gives a great overview of what he'll be testing. this is good enough to get a solid b (assuming you do the textbook problems). going to every class gives you the a.", "friesner is a decent professor, definetly better than the other two. his classes are not the most exciting, but he tells you exactly what you have to know, especially the day before the test he has a \"review\" day where he basically puts an outline on the board of what is on the test, and basically every topic on the test is covered in his outline.

familiar with/drawn to the christian tradition. if anything, take the class for somerville\u2013he's been teaching at columbia for decades and recites his wealth of knowledge each class in a way that is both humble and remarkable.", "somerville is a fucking pimp; that's all you need to know.", "professor somerville is extraordinarily knowledgeable. he speaks articulately and strives to answer students' questions as thoroughly as possible. still, he is honest enough to say \"i don't know, but i will try to answer as best i can\" when students want to know about something that is not very familiar to him. he is poised and direct but has a very dry sense of humor that can be truly delightful. he isn't cold or unkind, but he rarely smiles, so that, every time i achieved a smile (through hard work and my own rather dry sense of humor) from professor somerville, i felt truly rewarded.\ni don't know what the ta situation is going to look like in coming semesters. one ta was bright, engaged, and kind; the other was cold, rude, and bored. if you meet the tas and feel strongly about one or the other, even based purely on instinct, try to take a discussion section with the one you like. as in any class, this can really make a difference as the semester moves forward; i dreaded my discussion sections because i did not listen to my instincts.\nfinally, i would like to say a word about other reviews here, because a lot of them mention that professor somerville is boring - or at least that the topic is boring. my earnest advice to anyone thinking of signing up for this course is to take thorough notes, review them comprehensively, and ask professor somerville or one of the tas (again, preferably whichever you like best) about any topic that seems confusing to you. the material is only boring if you enter the class thinking, \"this material is going to be boring.\" i advise any prospective student not to think that way: enter with an open mind and let yourself get excited about the richly complex history of the christian religion.", "before i delve into this review, let me state that this was one of the most average classes i took while a carefree coed at cu.

time, but that his synapses still errantly fire, his daily affairs sorted our by dying muscle memory.\nhe knows how to captivate a classroom, only to trail off at the end of his statement, rendering the preceding background information useless. furthermore, he gets a ton of mileage off self-disparaging regarding his age and death. like any good biblical scholar, he has ammassed a following of effeminate graduate student followers, and for his class's ta's he selects the meekest members of his intellectual harem.\nof course, bobby s. does toss you the occasional curveball by wearing a

is definitely interesting if you care about the subject.  i personally am a devout catholic and was fascinated to see how christianity would be portrayed here differently than in my high school theology classes.  there were some clear differences.  for one thing, we didn't use the word \"heresy\" but instead said \"form of christianity prevalent before the formation of a formalized orthodox consensus\".  it was also a much less streamlined history than i was used to; it wasn't all aimed at \"where we are now\" because the course obviously doesn't presume its students have any relationship with the christian faith.  that said, somerville was very fair to the faith, not at all judgmental of believers and not at all \"blasphemous\" by the believers' standpoint.\nthe class is

but you should do it. the class can be interesting (especially if you are at all familiar with modern catholicism), but sometimes spending a whole class on the inclusion of two words into the nicaean creed can be.... excruciating (etymology joke for y'all). at other times though, like i said, if you're  familiar with modern catholicism, the  reason for  some obscure thing will just click, and

to say the little bit of work you have is graded easily. its not. two midterms worth 25% each, and a final worth 50%, with the question \"read this passage and relate its importance to christianity\" sounds easy, but you're expected to  include every relevant piece of information. a text analysis, text summary, historical context (past, present, and future  consequences of the text), other movements  it was related to, etc. really hard. i think most people were unpleasantly surprised at the grades they received on them (especially since these expectations weren't related to you till

be a b+. if you didn't, b. this criterion as part of your final grade is also conveniently never mentioned. and sucks. go to the discussion section. there's only 4 anyway.\noverall: bobby's great, the

up with that people think he is boring is that they are simply uninterested in the material. if you have more than a passing interest in christianity, the class is a must. somerville made me a religion major by presenting thoughtful, intelligent analysis of the roots of christianity. he's a giant in his field, and with good reason: he knows his stuff and communicates it well. taking something from this man should be a requirement for religion majors, and strongly recommended for everyone else--these are the types of classes we came to columbia to experience.", "this course is the

barely see you without his glasses).  the material is pretty interesting and he chooses interesting readings.  i attended about less than half of the lectures and that was more than enough.  not as easy a grader as other people might lead you to believe", "somerville is a great professor.  his lectures are very straightforward, and he writes the key terms on the board before class, so if you write them down, your notes will be in very good order and chronological for the most part.  this course is more of a history-based christianity course than a religion-based one... not too much theology but it is still very interesting.  this is probably because somerville is a religious historian.  nevertheless, this is good for history majors as it can be used to fulfill part of the major requirement. somerville's lectures are great, and he had 4 guest lecturers (2 of whom were tas), and each of them added another facet to the class, ranging from dr. boynton's lecture on music in the church, complete with sound clips of psalms, to steven schoenig sj's lecture on st. ignatius and the jesuits.  the reading may seem heavy, but he usually writes the reference book & pages where you can find more info about a key item, so you can usually look it up rather than reading the whole book, although some of the course books are really interesting.  he has everyone buy a course reader (and apologizes profusely over the $25 cost), which is composed of primary sources ranging from the didache to writings of martin luther, and he goes over some in class.  2all of these readings create further understanding of the lecture, and they are really helpful to read right after his lectures.  there are 6 additional books, 3 of which are sort of reference about the time period (2 are good, one's pretty dense), and 3 shorter books, 2 used for discussion sections and one used for the alternative paper.  all of these are really interesting.  as far as his exams go, they're pretty fair, and it is definitely ideal to go to the lectures as it's easier to make connections between what he says and what the books say, as they're more complementary than anything.  and if you don't go, then you're missing out on one of columbia's clearest, most dedicated lecturers and professors.", "sure, somerville is interested in christianity of the middle ages and it is an easy good grade, but i urge you only to take this class if you are compelled by early christianity and willing (and able) to start drooling over your notes from boredom. if you long to learn anything even slightly associated with the theology of modern christianity and you are not fascinated by the intricacies of medieval cannon law then .... stay away!", "this is not a review of prof. somerville, he is an excellent lecturer, clear and fair.  that  being said, before you sign up for this course, please be aware that it is heavily history based.  if you love history, you'll love this class.   for the most part it was names and dates, with little or no analysis of  theological/philosophical/sociological undercurrents.  also, it only goes up to the reformation, so if you want to learn anything substantial about protestantism, the enlightenment, or modern christianity, you'd best go elsewhere.", "although i'm currently taking the class, and have therefore not had the full somerville experience, i felt the duty to review him prior to fall registration.  i registered for this class because it fulfills a history major requirement and because i read that somerville is a god.  i must agree, somerville is awesome!!! his lectures are very consise & he is extremely articulate.  the class right now is 140+ and in a huge lecture hall, and from the back of the room i can here him perfectly.  the class is not a theology class (you're not going to learn about how to worship jesus), but instead talks about the religious history of christianity.  somerville's lectures are easy to follow, and he writes the key terms on the board, so you can take notes that follow his lecture.  the readings are really interesting, and he compiles a course reader with primary sources.  definitely take this class!!!", "very clear lecturer but can get a little boring. he is very easy to follow becasue he writes all the key terms for the lecture on the board before class starts so you know where class is going. he does try to spice things up with his jokes but inevitably he can get boring. the best part of the course is his course reader which is all primary sources. those readings are pretty interesting.", "professor somerville is an outstanding lecturer. his ability to convey course themes through cogent and concise presentations is truly a gift. having basically no interest in religion initially, i soon found myself engrossed in each lecture. his rapport with students is wonderful, and he is excellent about responding to students' concerns via email.", "prof. sommerville is amazing. absolutely the best teacher i have ever had. my first impression of him reminded me of mr. rogers--extremely pleasant, warm, and enthusiastic. the class itself was interesting, and at the end of every lecture i found myself taken back in awe of sommerville's intelligence and passion about the class. i was never disappointed that i had to gone to class. i was also extremely amazed by his eagerness to help with student questions or concerns. he was very responsive to emails, questions, and anything else you were curious about. it seems like he genuinely cares about the students and their understanding of the material. his occaisional cute tibits of humor (sort of like dad-jokes gone wrong) only add to his already engaging class. one good thing to note--he does not take attendence. i missed several classes, missed most of the discussion sections, but still got an a in the class. take the class!!! its great!", "a deeply intelligent and thoughtful person, also a kind human being. manages to cover a huge history clearly, organizes his thoughts and lectures incredibly well. a highly recommended class.", "somerville is well-organized, intelligent, witty (though he tends to hide it), and happy to get to know his students. the lectures are full of information, and while you may not find yourself sitting on the edge of your chair, he keeps you awake. he could probably move through the material a little more quickly if he didn't constantly repeat himself. the tas do the grading, but he's always happy to chat. he also speaks like a news anchor and paces to and fro making stange gestures with his hands. often seen walking in morningside heights holding his eight-year-old son's hand.", "some athletes just radiate competence. on the mets, robin ventura isn't flashy, he isn't the most talented, but you can always trust him to do his best and take care of the job. one might be able to tell from this metaphor that i am not an english major. anyway, somerville is one of the best professors i've had. his classes aren't fascinating, but they're very well organized (and delivered without notes). the grading is easy, the sections are unnecessary, and the quizzes are a little silly. nevertheless, great class, though i recommend that you actually be interested in the topic. as i indicated, he's not going to win you over with charisma, just sheer competence and dedication. the first day of class, someone asked a question he couldn't answer off the top of his head. the next day he brought in a book and discussed it for 5-10 minutes. you have to like that.", "somerville knows his stuff, and he's good if you like the stuff. not the most animated lecturer, he occasionally throws in a miserably humorless joke from religion circles. a nice, helpful man, there's nothing to be said against him. the reading is not crucial to success (gradewise) although some short texts must be read. fortunately it's not hard to figure out which ones are important. the discussion sections are vital if you want to do well on the two quizzes (short essay questions), and they help for the final too. i didn't come off very pleased with the course, though i must say that christianity isn't my thing. one problem that frustrates me: i still have no clear idea of what christianity is.", "hands down, the best lecturer i have had at columbia. perfectly organized lectures

and always ready to answer questions that are a trap in disguise. first of all, you need to do all the work on your own from reading the book to understanding the application of state and its command and the intuition behind every single interpretation and command and its relation to the real world because if you think you will understand one concept diligently by attending the class you are tremendously mistaken!\nat first, she was going at a slow pace and it seemed like a breeze and unlike what everyone else before described but man once we hit the third chapter she only cared about finishing the program despite most of the tas being absent because of the strike and she knows how crucial the understanding of state is crucial to answers the problem set in a decent way of assimilation but she kept on rolling with the lecture and the material while brushing through her notes with a total disregard to our understanding of the most important part which state and its interpretation. i found the material of the class pretty interesting and gripping and i was eager to learn at first but her utter lack of pedagogy disorganized way of teaching and lack of practice when it comes to the real shit was an incentive to never come to class and learn the material elsewhere. you have to do your due diligence outside the class in order to get a slight grip of what is rumbling through during the class and that if you are a quick study. let's not mention the disastrous and fiasco around her problem sets that keep on repeating themselves every single semester with the answers already published which make the grading unbearable to approach. the question is nothing close to what we covered in the lecture and the level of sophistication of proof demonstrations that are being asked are outside of the scope of what was covered in class!\nshe is also very inconsiderate when it comes to answering emails that are noted as important or urgent or time-sensitive. she is also very insensitive and inconsiderate when making extremely disrespectful and rude comments in front of the whole class. the midterm was a disaster and she did not take into consideration the condition of the exam and its impact on students which made it hard to even skim through each question. for the final, the fiasco was indescribable as she shoved 4 additional chapters that were barely covered in class. it's ironic how she mentioned in class the fact that she makes it hard for us to earn decent grades and it's because she wants us to learn but the vast majority ended up scarred for life hating the subject and neither learning nor earning good grades. i was an exception because i basically busted my b** and it felt like a 3 class, not one.\nfor the midterm and the final she prepares a slide with note lecture that she regurgitates and read in a lousy way without any practice or any chance to practice your mistakes and she calls it a review don't expect to get any sample

boundaries that have previously been set when necessary. i was very nervous about taking econometrics, but i ended up okay. i was a little less than one standard deviation above the mean on the midterm and final, and i ended up with an a- in the class.\nin an online world, this course tests knowledge and application of stata/r commands in exams. in in-person format, prof erden says proofs are tested on exams. taking an online exam on stata/r was a bit difficult, but she made the final a bit easier on us and gave us enough time to complete it.\npsets take a long time to do, especially if you have no stata/r background. find a ta with a teaching style that matches your learning style, and this will help. of course, the ta strike did affect me, but somehow i ended up doing okay in the second half of the semester.\nerden seems to care about students more than most professors. i appreciate her ability to cut off certain students who monopolized class time by frequently interrupting with questions.\nit is unfortunate that the lectures were not recorded for students in different time zones. she also does not post lecture slides before class, but she provides fair reasoning for it. it did help me take better notes during class.\nin summary, i\u2019d recommend you take her section.", "i went into the class worried that i was over my head, considering how scary the name of the course sounds. however, i couldn't be happier with the class and with professor erden. her psets are very fair and easy to accomplish. she teaches pretty well too, a good mix of slides and \"whiteboard\" writing. she emphasizes the application of the material through stata instead of pure theory, which makes this class one of the most useful and applicable classes columbia has to offer. she's also very attentive to class feedback and is willing to offer options so the class does well, appreciate it.\nthe only negatives are that her quizzes (two total, one taken so far) are difficult to finish in the time constraint since it is a pset-sized exam that requires stata, which isn't very cooperative at times. also, class attendance is required since she doesn't post zoom recordings.", "professor erden is a very reasonable and approachable professor. her lectures are clear and slides are comprehensive. the textbook is well written, and follows the course closely.\nthat said, econometrics can be a challenging subject given the nuances of implementation in stata and the amount of math. furthermore, the grading can be rather arbitrary because very little partial credit is offered. if you are meticulous and follow along with each lecture, this is a standard difficult course. lots of the learnings around causality, regression, difference in difference are needed for learning economic papers and doing more rigorous work in later classes, so the content is actually quite useful. the curve is not generous about 1/3 a, b, and c or worse, but this is a department policy. too many people inappropriately displace their anger at the subject matter, ta grading, and departmental curve towards professor erden. she's fair and good at explaining concepts, especially the big ideas.", "erden is the best!! she makes econometrics understandable and approachable with examples in life, and her humor is a bonus point. she cares about students' well being and is

intriguing that she could copy it erroneously) and she did not even bother to give greene the deserved credits. her exams were not error-free and the questions she chose to test did not represent well the content she covered in class. she jammed students with extra slides to study on their own, yet refused to answer clearly questions on her slides. she dictated the grading of the exam - adding points to students' exams on a random basis. she also threatened the ta for not standing on the same side with her.\nbeing her student for one semester is the most interesting experience one could ever have. one has the opportunity to witness jokes every lecture - seeing someone pretending to know everything but every five or ten minutes being stuck in basic course-related questions and

second-year, i had no idea what to expect. tatsumi-sensei is simply great, and i know other students in the class felt the same way. my japanese listening and speaking abilities immediately skyrocketed (probably by virtue of just listening to a native speaker for an hour a day). he can be a little bit of a stickler with grades and deadlines, but it shouldn't be a big problem since the schedule is clearly provided on the syllabus. he can be funny and generally keeps the vibe light-hearted. tatsumi puts emphasis on making the most natural-sounding japanese. while he never explained this explicitly, i often noticed him reconstructing students' grammatically correct sentences in favor of more natural ones. the single greatest thing about tatsumi is the amount and quality of feedback he gives. i was repeatedly impressed by how detailed the feedback was on the various essays/writing assignments. clearly he had put a lot of time and thought into it. you should take advantage of this and take his feedback to heart. if he sees you putting in the effort, he will meet you right there. ask questions and make mistakes with tatsumi, and don't feel bad about either: they are both essential at any level of language learning. going to class every day was actually enjoyable, and tatsumi made it that way. ultimately, tatsumi-sensei is a reasonable and decent guy. if you have any issues, communicate them to him and i'm sure he will be understanding. at the end of the semester, i found myself disappointed he wasn't teaching the class second semester.", "he\u2019s a

to advertise his music. it's like, the wrong forum. the class itself was an easy a with a typical japanese class workload.  but as someone who loves japanese, i found myself surprised when i noticed before each zoom class session that i became nauseated.  there are teachers who will teach as well as tatsumi but will teach with emotional maturity and respect for the students, someone like eguchi sensei for instance. there are simply better options, and you will not feel like each day is a stressful journey.", "i'm writing this review not because i'm angry and not because i'm even receiving a bad grade. i am writing it to inform people, who can make up their own minds, about tatsumi-sensei. you may consider my review, albeit negative, as coming from a rather neutral place.\ntatsumi has an anger management problem. and it detracts from the funny slides he has, the amount of japanese he speaks, and the potential for learning in his classes (i have taken two levels with him). as a senior who has had many a teacher, there have only ever been two things i do not tolerate: unfairness, and anger beyond normalcy. tatsumi isn't unfair. he has anger beyond normalcy.\ni am in no way the only one he's picked on. his anger, which comes out of nowhere, is directed at everyone at some point during each class. he is rude, loud, and condescending if you do not get the right answer on the very first try, and this can sometimes be on challenging material.  i remember once, a classmate simply used a ga instead of ha for a very long sentence, and tatsumi screamed for about 25 seconds in japanese. yes, screamed. i could see my classmate's poor frightened face over zoom.\nthe takeaway is, one should never bring their own anger and psychological problems to work, and tatsumi does.  his abrasive, explosive nature takes away from what could be a very enjoyable class.  i really do believe he needs help (no judgement here), but certainly, as a student at a university like this, i never thought i would ever encounter such unprofessionalism.", "tatsumi-sensei is extremely organized, helpful and quick-witted. his japanese classes are always fun to go to and he explains everything so clearly that you barely need to study for the tests. he is always willing to answer questions, replies to emails quickly and goes to great lengths to help students advance. i do hope that he could loosen up a little bit at times because he obviously has a more humorous side to his usual serious self. he is pretty strict on absences and deadlines so try not to mess up with him.\nall in all,

a little time on this class each day there is no reason why this shouldn't be an easy a, i was told...by the professor. i thought to myself, sounds good to me, i am interested in learning japanese and i am more than willing to put in the work every day to learn. boy was that statement wrong. what it should have said was, \"if you have already taken multiple courses in japanese, know all the kanji, and have an exceptional talent for learning eastern languages, you will surely be just fine.\" that is quite a shame really, because this is touted as an introductory japanese course for people that have little to know experience with any part of the japanese language.\ni'm sure if you came into this class having a good grasp on the introductory parts of the japanese language you would do just fine. by that i mean, you know your hiragana, katakana, some kanji, and basic sentence structures and particle usage. however, if you know none of this you are in for a rude awakening. having known only words like sushi, sashimi, and teriyaki, i wasn't exactly well versed in japanese. so that simple work load each night was more like 2 - 4 hours a night, every single night just to keep up. not to mention that you had to memorize a list of vocab and sentence structures for a quiz every single day at the start of class. after the first month or two the whole class was basically begging for the course load to slow down. we even let our professor know that we just couldn't keep up and we felt that our japanese language learning was suffering because of it. by two months in, nothing slowed down, and it become quite evident that people were beginning to be overwhelmed. constantly relying on the textbook in class just to remember basic words and sentence structures. many people, my self included, saw a noticeable decline in the amount of time spent on other classes because of the time required for this class. tatsumi-sensei, specifically stated that the columbia japanese department specifically tries to go 1.5 times faster than the average college. why? is there research stating that, that helps us learn? i'd venture to say not, but they seem to like that arbitrary rate of learning because, \"it's an elite college\". great, elite college, that's fine and dandy but i would sure love to learn something.\noverall, despite the class being completely at the whim of the department as a whole rather than tailored to the pace of each class, tatsumi-sensei did his best. he is not a bad professor by any means, and really does care about his students. if you get a mid to low b on a test he will call you into his office to go over the test with you, which is nice, but also somewhat alarming the first time it happens. however, you better hope that you are an auditory learner because you will have little visual material to learn from and almost no time to take notes. however, as i said, if you are like the 80% of class that has already studied japanese or knows a bunch of kanji and similar languages, then you'll be fine. if that doesn't describe you, best of luck, you are going to need it!", "i found tatsumi sensei's class very rewarding. he almost always speaks in japanese during class. lots of speaking practice in class: conversation or picture on the slides and the entire class or one person will read the conversation. examples are usually standard, occasionally entertaining.\nwe had to make a blog with two journal-type entries and a fair bit of work on the katakana project.\ni found the katakana project tedious and not too useful. it consists of finding examples of katakana on ads, magazines, products etc and analyzing the katakana usage. we also have to make a literary work (manga, story or poems). it will take as much time as you want.", "tatsumi-sensei is a new japanese instructor at columbia, and i had him for both semesters of 1st-year japanese, so if he is reading this, that will narrow it down to only two students...\ntatsumi-sensei is quite serious about the class and may come across as a little more stern than many of the other instructors at first, but he tends to make a lot of humorous gestures and jokes in class. he will answer any question about japanese, no matter how off-topic or simple. and he is very quick in replying to e-mails and very open to classes during and after class.\nhe really wants his students to begin learning the language and continue into 2nd and hopefully 3rd-year japanese and beyond. eventually you will be looking forward to coming to japanese class every day.\nthe first day of the course should tell you what kind of person he is (assuming he continues to give the \"surprise\" introduction every year to his first-year students, which i guess...is not really a surprise anymore if you are reading this before you take his class) and his general attitude on language acquisition.\nhe uses a powerpoint-style teaching style (as do the other instructors, i believe) and will ask pairs or groups to make conversation, something that that is very helpful especially when learning to speak a language (arguably the most difficult of the four main language skills). and he will call on you to talk in front of the class (in your chair) so if you are not prepared for class, the entire class will know! do not think this is a bad thing, because it will help build your confidence over time.\nthe beginning is always a bit rough for everyone, unless you have taken japanese elsewhere, but as long as you read the main yellow textbook, which has all the grammar and vocabulary you need (daily vocab. quizzes, but no grammar quizzes in the beginning), you should have little problems.\njust make sure you don't fall behind on the vocabulary and grammar,

went to him with help on my paper, he was quick to offer numerous primary source recommendations once i told him my area of interest, and sent back my rough draft within 2 days. his love, nay exuberance, for the material is contagious. though the first half is a tad dry, the classes following the midterm were brimming with french accents and knightly impersonations. he draws on the primary sources frequently during his lectures and will often want to discuss them with the class. ** make sure to do the readings- or at least the primary sources** if there is one thing he wants you to learn from this class, it is how read a primary source, and read it well. some of the texts are more interesting than others, but focus on what seems important and what he talks about in lecture. his tests were difficult and you certainly had to know your stuff, but like he said, he is testing what you know and not what you dont know. if you go to class and do the readings you should be fine.",

additional long readings aside from the already heavy cc syllabus. some discussions are interesting, some are pretty boring. he really digs into these texts and makes these connections that aren't really there and in a way that is just irksome. aside from that, he is a very hard grader on papers. to begin with, the topics are hard and twisted and then he gives you a list of all the grammatical problems that are wrong with your essay (reminder, this guy is a history teacher). you can spend days on your essay and you still won't get above a b+. i'd say the only positive thing about this class is that participation is like 35% of the grade...but if you wanna get an a for that you better read every text and talk his ear off. the second worst class i've taken at columbia.", "at first i didn't like professor kosto. his teaching/speaking style (if you can call it that in a seminar) is rather abrupt, and he often assumes that you know more than you do about current scholarship - which i suppose is fine for seniors, but as i'm a freshman it made the course difficult. as we began to write term papers, though, kosto showed his helpful side. he was willing to suggest good source material and read several drafts of papers. the subject for this seminar was a rather nebulous one, so while i can't say i learned much (i learned that the topic was nebulous, for example, and how to do chicago style citations of journals) i can say that the time i spent on this course was not a waste.", "i agree with the previous review in that kosto teaches this course in a discontinuous style. his thematic approach to the material is unusual. some students may find this approach welcome and effective.  i found it difficult to reassemble the material chronologically to discern historical trends and causal relationships.  despite this criticism, i was surprised and pleased at the amount i learned during the semester.  i dislike kosto\u00e2\u2019s approach yet, i have to admit, his teaching style may be valuable and refreshing to some students.  kosto has an engaging, enthusiastic lecture style.  his generational specific asides amuse some, but appear gratuitously juvenile to others.  i was as impressed with his scholarship as he is.  he generously shares his passion for primary source documents and manuscript study with his students, and a course with kosto can be valuable for all who are interested in historical research of any kind.  more than a course on the middle ages, this is a boot camp for primary source analysis.  the ta\u00e2\u2019s (carlos and alaine) were mature, focused and task oriented.  i found the discussion sessions to be unusually valuable and was disappointed when they were discontinued mid semester. carlos and alaine were a grounding counter-balance to kosto\u00e2\u2019s thematic lectures.  i did not feel their grading was unfair.  i do agree it was tough.  i learned a lot from both the ta\u00e2\u2019s and, for me, they saved the semester.\nmany students like professor kosto a lot.  he loves his material, is committed to teaching, his lectures are well organized, and students leave his class with a strong set of tools for research and analysis.  he seems to genuinely like young people (beware older gs-ers), and has a disciplined, yet open minded approach to his material. he does have \u00e2\u201cfavorites,\u00e2\u201d students who he knows their names and respects and answers their questions. everyone else will get brushed off fairly rudely.  this does not detract from the value one can glean from the class.  i am glad i took this course despite my discomfort with his thematic approach, and that i just disliked kosto personally. you may well have a \"captain, my captain\" experience with kosto like some students do. i cannot deny that he is a valuable educator and i learned a lot\u00e2\u2026that is the whole point. a course with him will serve any prospective history major well.", "the salient facts of my 1061 early middle ages experience are its discontinuity and unfair grading. these are salient because they are bad. the class itself was not. despite presenting the material in a discontinuous fashion, kosto was a good lecturer. he is generally excited about the material and has an amiable demeanor (which i think is a clear source of bias, possibly fair, in his favor). as for the tas, alain is an equally amiable fellow and did an excellent job in leading discussion (albeit a horrible job of reading papers). however, i think kosto needs to review his grading policy. he has, or certainly the tas say he has (to cover their backs for giving low grades), a \"you need to be special to get an a\" policy. it was specifically couched in the terms \"is against grade inflation.\" now i don't think these are necessarily bad ideas, but, kosto and his tas need to work much, much harder if they want to implement them fairly. there were almost no comments on my final paper or mid-term and the ones i received were positive. i got a b. i am very bitter. on this account, i would not reccomend this class to most people. the only people who i would reccomend it to are those who will go to office hours regularly. this at least, might get them to read your paper.\nfinally kosto's implementation of the grade policy is methodologically incorrect. you don't stop grade inflation by reducing a's and increasing b's. if the course were done objectively, a 1/3 the class would have gotten below c and failing.", "amazing. kosto is brilliant. as someone else put it, captain kosto steers the class through some of the most obtruse and influential texts of western civilization. he never lectures, but intervenes if the discussion gets off topic. if you have cc with him, you are going to learn. but kosto doesn't take any crap. so you better read, participate in class, and work your ass of on papers and exams. kosto knows the main argument of every book we've read by heart. he is an expert in medieval philosophy, so careful laughing at augustine...", "a very solid class. prof. kosto is a pretty good lecturer. he has a very good understanding of the overarching social, political, religious and economic developments that occur over this 800 year period and conveys it very nicely in lecture. he weaves together this very rich period of history, full of migrations, identity formation,  the interrelation of the developments in byzantium, persia, islam, and the west in a masterful way. go to lecture. the readings are ok. i wish the textbook were a little more factually involved but it still gives an excellent feel for the trends and movements of the early middle ages. the primary sources are great too. this is a 1000 level history course -- so be prepared for being pegged on footnoting and bibliography issues. i wish it were less a class on developing critical  analysis skills, but then again it is a 1000 level course and for those who havent acquired such skills a course like this is necessary. the ta sections are ok -- not great. the tas do tend to grade a little harshly but whatever -- if you dont care too much about maintaining a sparkling 4.0 gpa but do care about learning, take this class. you will gain a deep insight into what happened to the late roman empire, the rise of christianity and the papacy, the \"barbarian invasions\", impact of charlemagne upon europe, the impact of islam upon europe, the birth of feudalism and much much more. take it. kosto will make it worth your while.", "professor kosto- great.  early middle ages- boring as hell.  ta's- difficult and unfriendly.  so, despite kosto being wonderful (which he is, look at all the other reviews!) this class is definitely not worth it.", "i truely found kosto to know a lot, but he treats his students as if they were freshman in high school.  i realize this is a thousand level course, but teaching students how to write a thesis sentence, read a primary source, and write coherent sentences takes up a large junk of time.  his lectures are extremely organized.  you'd have to be an idiot to not know what was going on.  he writes everything on the board, as a high school teacher would, in outline form.  he has an excellent sense of humor.  his view of history is to question everything and look at everything in the context of knowing the people in history really didn't know what would happen next.  these points are stressed.  if you only study notes, expect a b- to b+ in his class, if you want better, take notes on the readings, divide the readings up with friends, and kiss butt to your ta.  i did fairly well, but if i had to do it again, i would probably not take this course.  take a bulliet.", "if you have any interest in history take kosto's class. the man is brilliant, engaging, and makes the time period (about which i knew nothing and you probably don't either) come to life. his lectures are well organized and make you want to stay awake. at times, he'll turn the fairly large lecture class into a discussion, which is cool. he wants his students to learn how to be historians--there's a lot of emphasis on using primary/secondary sources. this might be the best class i've ever taken at columbia.", "prof. kosto is not only a brilliant person, but he is also an extremely talented teacher.  he makes cc comprehensible, challenging, thought-provoking and absolutely worthwhile.  he implicitly guides class discussion with his interesting questions, thoughtful comments and sardonic wit, making sure that everyone stays involved.  he has been known to play cole porter songs and to ask the class to explain their significance in relation to the cc syllabus.  he is always willing to discuss paper topics and to read drafts, and he takes the time to write detailed comments on both style and content.  above all, prof. kosto encourages students to move beyond textual analyses so that they may develop their own opinions of each philosopher's work.  it is rare to find such an all-around great professor.", "a great professor.  very engaging in class, weaving in student comments with his own meticulously prepared lectures.  he outlines each class on the board before he begins, which helps you to get a sense of what you should be taking away from each class, since there is a great deal of information--a little too much to process--nonetheless, the themes are well drilled.  a primary goal of kosto's is to teach the class how to read primary sources, and the skill is a major theme on midterm, final, and term paper.  this is an excellent class to take as intro to college history because of the training given in primary source reading.\nvery animated and friendly during class and afterwards for questions, but curiously distant (surly, peut-etre?) during office hours.  prefers email.", "a terrific class.  kosto is a great lecturer: organized, brilliant, engaging, open to questions, and often funny.  his efforts to turn our medium-sized lecture (about 50 students) into a discussion were actually effective (and interesting) because he could lead it so well.  the class is preoccupied with the process of being a historian (the \"questions\" of history, the use of sources) as much as the material of the period itself.  he chose to lecture on specific, important topics, instead of trying to cover the entire period in lecture (a much more effective way to teach the course, i think).  all in all, i can't think of a single class that professor kosto could teach that i wouldn't consider taking.  he expects a lot of his students, but it was definitely a positive and worthwhile experience.", "great course, great professor.  its the type of course that takes a large section of history and really gives a great overall sense of what happened -- all the while reading a selection of primary sources, doing yoru own analysis of contemporary secondary sources -- and sitting through engaging and densely packed lectures.\nutterly and absolutely worthwhile.  prof. kosto is an open yet critical professor -- he'll take what you say seriously, but will make sure its plausible.  all that, and he's a nice guy.", "i would just like to concur with all the previously submitted positive reviews of professor kosto.\nthis man is interesting and funny and engaging.\nhis class taught me for the first time how to approach history by dealing mainly with primary source material and emphasizing interpretation and possibilities rather than \"facts\" and \"right answers.\" be careful though - this class won't hold your hand - it's worth it to keep up on the reading! and don't slack on the textbook readings - they become important when you're being tested and have to actually place the lectures and discussions within a chronology of some sort.\nalso, there is time set aside in many lectures for class discussion which is not so fun if you haven't read!", "awesome professor! in my four years at columbia, professor kosto's class still remains my favorite. how often will you have a class where the professor is the one who has to tell the students to leave when time's up because they're so involved in the discussion? he doesn't lecture the whole class (which is how a core class should be!), but what he does say is golden. don't go for the easy a cuz you won't get it...go to be challenged and to learn!", "horrible grader!!!!!!!! ok, if you are still reading then you should take his course. i dont know if he is in fact a horrible grader (though we didnt get our final grades back yet, it is clear that he is at worst a fair grader--you will not get an easy a). you should not take his class if you only want an easy grade, you should take his class if you want to learn cc well. the class is all discussion with some streering by captain kosto. he is very big on tying the whole curriculum together, and you will learn to appreciate the collection of works chosen. he adds a few books here and there, but these additions really focused and enhanced the traditional curriculum. i really enjoyed this class (i stayed awake and i am usually a doodle-or-fall-asleep-fuseas type of kid) and took a lot away from the discussions. overall, i highly recommend this class. [studies show that blingbling is the sound that the diamond makes]", "challenging but fascinating. kosto is a wonderful lecturer with a great sense of rhythm and structure -- he puts the dots on the map, so to speak, and you can't quite figure out where he's going with it, and then in a flourish he connects them all and suddenly, effortlessly, you see the big picture. this happened within individual lectures and also over the span of the entire course, and he was one of those professors who really deserved applause on the last day of class when he made everything we had learned seem clear, simple, vital. oddly enough, there were several (about ten) elderly (over 60 years old) auditors in the class who spoke very often. it was annoying."], "summary": ["He is organized and engaging, even funny, but not an easy grader. He makes students read a lot, but helpful in office hours. He is pretty good overall.\n"]}]
