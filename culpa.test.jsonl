concepts very clearly and it's super helpful to reference the experiments from the videos on exams. the grading can be a bit hard but if you pay attention to what she says in class and study her material, i had no issue getting at least an a- on every exam.\nthere is also a required zoo visit halfway through the semester and you have to make it up if you can't go with the rest of the class. i found the zoo trip not particularly helpful, but it was really fun and you get to hangout with cords outside of class.\ni also had professor cords during an interesting time (*cough* covid-19

have been. marina cords is a woman dedicated to her field and to this class. i found her lectures to be incredibly straightforward and clearly formatted. she readily made sure that all materials for the class were available online, and uploaded review packets before each test that were really helpful. she likes getting to know her students, so i highly recommend going to her office hours and just chatting with her. it'll probably up your grade in the class, and she might even be able to help you with research opportunities on campus.\nyes, there are lots of little assignments and tests/quizzes throughout the course. however, i felt like that kept me on top of the material and also gave me lots of chances to improve my grade. i thought the trip to the zoo with the class was a fantastic learning experience, in which we were able to apply our knowledge of primate behavior to the animals in front of us. my only negative comment about the class would be that sometimes i felt like time spent in discussion sections was wasted on watching outdated scientific videos, although some of them were entertaining and educational.\noverall, i would recommend this course to any student

of the readings, completed the study guides, read the lecture reviews, and took great notes, but i still didn't do well on any of the exams. realistically, the assigned readings aren't required for the tests and most of the material is available if you answer the study guides, read the lecture reviews, and go over your class notes, but remember that all of those equal up to be a lot of things to memorize. also, \"short answer\" isn't really short - prepare to have \"explain more\" if you just write a concise sentence.\noverall, i'd suggest this to students that have a decent science background already, rather than someone that is maybe a literature major. i learned a lot about a subject i never would have learned about in detail, so i'm glad i chose this subject, but i wish i had

{"name": "Christopher J Washburne", "reviews": ["overall, he's a great professor. he's very passionate about what he teaches and his enthusiasm really shows during his lectures. sometimes i think he overextends himself in terms of connecting various historical events to the music/culture of a specific country, but overall he does a good job of introducing you to the big names of each musical genre. having completed the course, i felt i learned a lot about music in general, and the various genres addressed by this class.\nwhat really irritated me about this instructor however is how he tries very hard to act like a \"woke hipster\", probably because he's a white man who is talking about musical artists who are predominantly black. it's incredibly \"cringe\" to watch and i wish he would just stop, but it persisted throughout the entire semester.\nin terms of the actual grade, this class is extremely easy. there are three concert reports that are 3 pages each. as long as you reference the terms he brings up in class and the readings, you'll do fine. there is a final project that is due at the end of the class and he gives you a lot of freedom to do whatever you want. the final exam was commenting on two contemporary music videos and was probably the easiest final i've ever taken. he also has you do seemingly ridiculous things like cook caribbean food and take a dance lesson, all of which are easy to do.\ntake this course if you want a very easy global core.. workload: 3 concert reports: you watch a youtube video of a concert and write 3 pages on it.\n1 final project: you can literally do anything you want, he's very open to anything. most did a cookbook because it was so easy.\n1 final exam: he has you write about two music videos.\nvarious oddball type assignments, like taking a dance lesson and cooking food.", "this class could be fantastic if it wasn't taught by a white professor from ohio who happened to write one book on salsa. oh wait, excuse me 2- he just released a second one this year on latin jazz. i'm surprised he did not announce that in class as many classes felt like just trips down memory lane for him and bragging rights of working with tito puente & celia cruz. don't get me wrong, if this class was just called \"salsa\" it would be brilliant!! five stars! but it's not. it's meant to explore the many genres of the caribbean but he failed to equally or fairly do this. we spent two classes on soca, barely scratching the surface, and 2 classes on reggae while the rest was largely teachings on salsa and his adventures as a professional trombonist. i would say if you want an easy grade to fulfill your global core requirement, go for this class. if you can handle him saying \"milieu\" every five seconds and dramatically emphasizing african roots or influences in every caribbean genre to protect himself from being called out for not being \"woke\", props to you. but i would warn you that you are about to learn a very lopsided and sometimes uncomfortable history of the caribbean shaped by a white man.\nexamples:\n- he played this extremely offensive song called \"el africano\" after saying how in real life he has now decided to stop playing it due to blm but then proceeds to play it in its entirety to 222 people. when pushed to provide an explanation for playing this offensive song, he replied with \"good question, why am i teaching you this?\" making the class do the labor of understanding his poor decision making to include insensitive music rather than him taking responsibility for being hypocritical.\n- he played \"rum & coca cola\" by the andrews sisters as one of the few songs we heard from calypso. this song is a racist caricature sung by three white american women.\n- he centers the conversation about haiti entirely around voodoo (a common but ill-informed american approach to \"understanding\" haiti), exoticizing and religiously fetishizing haiti's musical genres.\ntldr; take this class because it's easy but listen to the lectures with a huge mound of salt because the non-caribbean professor doesn't know anything about caribbean culture after salsa. this class will introduce you to a small portion of great caribbean songs but will provide misleading or false information about the history of its genres (sans salsa). workload: - 3 easy listening assignments, you don't actually have to do the readings- just need to be able to reference them in the papers\n- miscellaneous credits like take a dance class, eat caribbean food, etc\n- final exam which was a 4 page paper analyzing two music videos", "take the class! the professor is cool and funny, the material is excellent, the songs are from different backgrounds... plus, it counts for the global core! what a fun class!. workload: ok. for the final project you can do whatever you want: take salsa classes and write about the experience, interview some students with a caribbean background, perform a specific dance or even film a short documentary.", "best class i took at columbia. learned so much about jazz and picked up a new passion. professor washburne should have a gold nugget.. workload: completely manageable", "professor washburne is probably the coolest person on the planet. he previously played trombone with a lot of the salsa greats in nyc and on south american tours. he's now head of the jazz studies department, and he still plays with different salsa groups, other columbia profs, and his own band, s.y.o.t.o.s. (see you on the other side). be thankful if you are lucky enough to take this class from him. the course is fun and the material is engaging. whatever you do, don't come to class and sit on facebook or watch youtube videos. listen to what the man is saying. his stories are intense and personal, and what's more is his passion for relaying his interests and experiences to his students. it helps to have an appreciation for caribbean musics, i admit i probably wouldn't listen to every genre explored in this class recreationally. but the point is that to understand modern hip-hop, reggaeton, and reggae, you need to have the background of the earlier colonial music styles. each lecture consists of the hypnotic voice of washburne, paired with musical examples from each genre explored. the course covers musics of puerto rico, cuba, the dominican republic, haiti, jamaica, and trinidad and tobago.. workload: the workload is pretty light. there are typically readings for each class, drawing from washburne's book and caribbean currents by peter manuel. along with other studies by leading ethnomusicologists, there can often be around 50 pages of reading for each class. you should do all of the readings to get the most out of the course, but relatively few quiz questions are on the readings, and you can get by with skimming most of them. you also have 3 different concert reports, which are supposed to be on concerts from different caribbean musical genres. however, because 90% of the live caribbean music in the city is salsa, he will generally allow you to see more than one salsa group perform. the concert reports are graded by tas. in the reports, you are supposed to include the names of the songs, explain what characteristics of the band's playing define the music as whatever kind of music it is (for example, a salsa band having timbales and a trumpet section, or playing songs that have extended montunos), and comment on your personal experience (atmosphere, food, interactions with band members). aside from the concert reports, there are 2 quizzes. when i took this course, the first quiz ended up not counting because there was a grading discrepancy that gave a disproportionate amount of people low grades. anyway, the 2nd quiz was entirely multiple choice and featured around 12 listening questions and 38 non-listening questions. it was straightforward if you paid attention in class and reviewed your notes for an hour or two the night before the quiz. the final project is a 10 page paper you collaborate on in groups of 4 on a subject of your choice related to caribbean music. it's due on the last day of class. the tas are helpful if you have any questions related to the final project. if you do all the readings, take good notes, and listen to the musical examples online before quizzes, an a is easily achievable.\nworkload breakdown:\n-weekly readings (can be very long)\n-3 concert reports (40% of grade)\n-2 quizzes

caribbean music and salsa in particular, and this makes for delightful lectures.\nthe class follows a format that approximately covers one caribbean country a week. cuba, puerto rico and jamaica are the big ones and might take longer to go through, but there are many others too. you not only learn about the music per se but all aspects that revolve around it: social, political, economical, etc. essentially, this allows you to appreciate not only *how* the music sounds but *why* it sounds the way it does.\nwith 3/4 of the semester in, i can honestly say that this is one of my favorite classes

has a pretty big ego and likes to go off on tangents and  talk about his encounters with famous people...a lot. that said, this is a good class, and washburne is a very good lecturer (although theatrical at times). with washburne you get the additional benefit of the perspective of a working jazz musician. i came out of the class knowing a lot more than i did going in, and who can complain about listening to great jazz for homework? the readings are very interesting as well, though not entirely necessary. exams weren't too brutal, but because of the size of the class grading is firm. if you're a musician (especially a jazz musician), this class is an absolute breeze - unless you take washburne up on his offer of doing a final project instead of the three concert reports the rest of the class has to do (you still have to go to the concerts, but only need to hand in one page). stick with the concert reports.. workload: three concert reports, midterm, final. reading and listening, which will definitely help you out.", "far be it from me to disparage this man.  he's an exciting lecturer, who cares deeply about the music.  being in a class with him is a joy, as he is a showman

on...\nthe warning i will give is this: the man does not care at all about the students.  he really does not care about you at all.  if you go to his office hours, he will answer emails while you are talking to him.  in person, he is as cold as he is warm in his lectures.  not mean, not nasty.  just cold.\ndoes this mean he's a bad person, or that you should not take his classes?  absolutely not.

him in person.. workload: easy tests, just show up to class and do the listenings", "by far the best class i have taken!! i am not a music major and i really enjoyed this class. washburne is an engaging professor and really inspiring. class is great- he always has interesting stories to tell about celebrities and jazz musicians. studying for the midterm and final takes longer than you expect but its not hard and its fair. he practically tells you the essay questions beforehand. also, if you dont know any music, like i didnt, study in advance- listen to the music a few days before the midterm/final to get acclimated. take this class take this class take this class- best to take it with friend because studying will be easier and going to jazz performances will be more fun.. workload: midterm, final and three concert reports ( no more than 3 pgs!)- the jazz reports depend on your ta- so after your first report speak to your ta to see where you can improve they love that!! he wants everyone to do well- so if you think you lost points go to professor washburne and talk to him and he will prob give you points back- show them you care!!!", "i don't hate washburne, but feel that all these raves are a bit misleading.  i took the class because it sounded interesting.  it had its moments, but i found that if you don't have a deep passion for jazz, you might find  yourself annoyed with washburne's somewhat arrogant enthusiasm.  he's  one of those professors that has developed a cult following, which, if you're not part of it, gets to you after a while.  if you like the guy, i guess, you can get past his habit of repeating everything about 4 times and the way he self promotes his band in class.  i ended up sneaking out of lectures half the time, and paying for it on the exams.  others seemed to have a better experience than i did, but i'd recommend sitting in a few lectures before registering, because he's not for everyone.. workload: ", "if you want to remember your academic experience fondly, then all you need to do is take a class with professor washburne. he is the kind of teacher who normally exists only in fantasy. he is brilliant, sweet, hilarious, passionate, and, maybe best of all, extremely interested in his students. whether you are a jazz fanatic or novice, you will leave his class with both a strong interest in and understanding of the

very happy to learn some social history as well.  as everyone else has said, washburne is really funny and thorough at the same time.  he brings in a variety of different perspectives on jazz and is very responsive to students' input (remarkable in a lecture of 200 people!)  you get to listen to examples of what he's talking about in class, and he stops the music frequently to explain the importance of what you just heard.  you do not need a musical background to do well in this class, and you certainly don't need to be a music major, although it helps to have taken music hum.  i would recommend this class highly.. workload: easy!  3 concert reports, but who doesn't like going to jazz concerts?  and easy midterm and final.  there are assigned readings and listening examples, but i didn't do a single one of them and i still did fine.", "i would encourage anyone to take this class. i loved it. i would list it as one of my top five best classes at the university; as a major, it was definitely the best one in the music department. yes, it is an elective, and non-majors can take it, so it doesn't cater to hardcore music theorists or historical musicologists. however, the music is fun and fabulous, and washburne delivers interesting and funny lectures. furthermore, the most important thing i took away from this class was a newfound appreciation for caribbean cultures. i even learned to salsa dance!. workload: three one-page concert reports, one 5-6 page field study, midterm, and final. the tests are actually kind of fun to prepare for, because all you really have to do is sit there and listen to the music, which is great. washburne's a very fair grader.", "thus far, the best class i have taken at columbia/barnard. everyone should take this class. prof washburne is funny, laid back, sincere, an extremely talented, rare professor. i think what i liked most about him was how sincere he was to us, and how much he loved the material. the class was 150+, but he made it feel like we were just all hanging out. his lecture style was never aloof or boring, but as though he was sharing what he loved with a few friends. he is an extremely talented musician, as well (has his own band, used to play for tito puente). even if you don't like music, or jazz (or don't think you do), take it anyway.. workload: fair and fun: readings are interesting, 1 midterm and final, very fair, and 3 concert reports in which you have to go out and see a jazz concert and report on it using what we learn in class.", "washburne is highly overrated.  while it's amusing to have a professor throw \"cool\" words into his lectures, his simplisitic understanding of the history of the caribbean is painful.  washburne makes highly generalized statements without any accurate historical information to back them up.  granted, he is passionate about music (go hear him at smoke- he's wonderful)  but passion can only keep a student interested for so long.  unlike other classes at columbia, which sometimes have an overly academic feel to them, there is no scholarly element to this class at all. i learned close to nothing and was also bored. washburne should keep his evening job as a musician.. workload: pretty easy. 3 simple concert reports (the most difficult part is actually finding concerts to go to), a midterm, a final, and final group project.", "washburne is an

disappointed with nearly every one of my classes at columbia over the past 3 years, even to the point where i left school.  this class makes me glad i came back.  the professor is engaging and passionate and provocative and the subject matter is really genuinely interesting.  but i can still imagine a professor making jazz boring.  prof. washburne excites students about jazz and music in general, and even incorporates larger issues such as art/music's role in society, racism, social/political context, and gender issues beautifully.  he is truly a fabulous professor.  not to mention the ta's, who are accessible, funny, informative, and fair.  this course is wholly fulfilling - the subject matter, the professor/ta's, the books, the concerts, everything.  kids aren't skipping his late-afternoon springtime classes - doesn't that say something?  can columbia please hire profs based on their teaching ability as *well* as their accomplishments outside of the classroom?  instead of just the latter?  prof. washburne does both; he is a figure in the jazz scene in the city as well.  he is truly a great asset to columbia.  don't miss this class!. workload: 3 concert reports (3 pgs each - easy)\nmoderately difficult midterm and final\nnot an easy a, but certainly an attainable one.  pay attention to details in class as exams are almost entirely lecture-based.  may not go in depth enough for music majors or those with a decent music theory background, but take it for the social context he places the music in anyway.", "phenomenal teacher!!!! extraordinary. his enthusiasm and the great music make it worthwhile 9am class. i strongly recommend this class to anyone, irregardless of your interest in music. he really is a columbia gem. attending lecture is a must, since exams are based on material taught in class (but if you pay attention then the exams are easy). theres no need to do the reading except that the book is very clear and fun to read-i ended up doing all the readings on the syllabus.. workload: midterm, final and paper. lot of leeway on paper topic.", "this review is intended for advanced music majors, so i don't mean to offend everyone else who loves washburne. he is one of the most popular professors at columbia, and he has a sort of cult following among music majors who don't know much about jazz but do realize that it's some of the best music out there. and he's okay as far as teaching a basic introductory survey of jazz to people who know nothing about it. but for someone who already knows a lot about music, his classes (i've taken several) are very elementary. if you've even heard of eric dolphy, then v2016 will be way too easy for you and you'll get frustrated with washburne's factual errors. if you're a music major who just wants an easy a, then this is fine if you can sit through it.. workload: very manageable even for a non-music major. ridiculously easy for anyone who's taken a music history and is used to writing concert reports. but if you do take the class, you need to show up; his tests are based entirely on lecture and you need to get used to his agenda in order to do well.", "all of the other reviews seem extremely exaggerated. washburne is good in that he is a fairly enthusiastic lecturer. also, he knows a fair amount about music itself; he was good at explaining basic musical concepts. however, there were several downsides to his class. he presented a simplistic view of history; he often just repeated truisms to explain historical periods. he told several stories, that while amusing, simply weren't true. for instance, his description of how berlioz came to compose the symphony fantastique was just totally wrong. what's more, the correct version is in the textbook. another example is he presented a theory of the origins of beethoven's deafness as fact; nobody is actually sure why beethoven went deaf. this led me to wonder whether other implausible sounding stories he told both about his personal experience and about the lives of composers were also untrue. also, he really didn't challenge the class very much, it could have been taught at a much higher level. while i did learn a fair amount about music, i felt like i could have learned a lot more. far too often, washburne seemed willing to simplify things rather than deal with a more complex, but more accurate version of reality. on the whole, a decent, but not terrific professor.. workload: midterm, take home final, three concert reports. all very easy.", "if you don't take this class before you graduate they should strip away your ivy. washburne is unbelievable. his lecturing is so engaging that i would often find myself checking the time and wishing i had double period washburne. additionally, the music that we listened to was amazing (some might say orgasmic). i never loved jazz before this class, but i am now addictted to the genre (i just bought 5 jazz cds and can't tear myself away from the jazz pieces that are posted for the class). you will leave this course with a comprehensive understanding of the musical and cultural progression of jazz from its inception through today. take this class!! take this class!! take this class!! a funny and passionate teacher, great material, a ticket to explore the city and its music scene-this class has got it all. put it this way, everyone that i spoke to was

of the musicians, the politics behind the music, and so on. he's an excellent teacher.. workload: decent.", "this guy is probably one of the better professors that you'll ever have. his knowledge and background with the music that is studied (he's played with tito puente, mark anthony, whitney houston, etc etc), is extensive and his feel for the music is great. although the course is lecture based and can be a little boring at times, his humor and stories about his experiences lighten things up. of course, you get to listen to music of the caribbean styles, and get to see how they influence the music we all listen to today. he really wants you to learn and appreciate the music rather than just cram for tests and go to concerts just for the assignment.. workload: workload for this semester

fantastic. take anything he offers.. workload: three short concert reports, midterm, final. not a tough grader, but you really need to know the music.", "wow. the greatest professor i've ever

He is knowledgable, enthusiastic, approachable, and humourous.

formally understand various aspects of software engineering. it is most beneficial for students without prior work experience. however, as an experienced professional, i have learned a great deal about software testing.\nthe lectures were loosely structured. professor kaiser covered theoretical topics in-class via real-world examples, code snippets, and online resources. on many occasions, we discussed interesting topics such as autonomous driving software and testing ai systems. tas were helpful in troubleshooting individual assignments. sometimes shirish (head ta) gave in-class tutorials

difficult, but very tedious and boring. you do surprisingly little coding, which is ironic for a \"software engineering\" course. writing \"cool\" software won't score you more points in the class. if you absolutely must take this course, do not be ambitious about the projected you will create. you won't receive extra points because your project is \"cool\" or \"harder.\" most of your grade hangs on the writing/documentation you do -- and you will spend more time on this than anyone would want to. so make your software easy to document and easy to test. you really only spend a month or two

(do some scaling, lining, put references etc..and let prof speak some history for half a semester....) if you by chance happen to visit jonathan bell and ask for why you got a c or b or something in between, he will search through that report and say, your heading was bold when it should have been italic..or your paper is not strongly supporting this or that.....what the fuck...?you paid tuition for that?and after not learning anything for a semester...you get a c to b. another half of semester you will end up doing some project of your choice and demoing in class what you did etc. teacher was suppose to teach and that never happened...and now you find yourself suddenly giving presentation in front of class on something....\nwaste of tuition and a poor grade.\nyou wont learn anything in this course, because she wont teach you. moreover if you happen to not please them in presentation or in project, you will get a poor grade that will cost you gpa and later jobs.\njonathan bell is an asshole ta who has a big ego. he rejoices in screwing people's grades and nothing else. he can never agree to anything you say or propose. it should strictly adhere to what he thinks is best and what he likes. if that is not the case, you lose grade and points. why does columbia even allow gail kaiser to take classes? and what do students learn after taking her classes? all her courses share same story and i was victim....\natleast you dont become one....and please please drop this course....take something else somewhere if not at columbia.....if you have to...but dont take this course....you will repent all your life for having taken this course under gail kaiser with jonathan bell as ta.. workload: not much, but i still question myself what i learnt in this course? better i did not join college..or atleast not columbia seas or dropped out of college....but i had no options....but you probably have if you are reading this...", "i would not recommend this course unless a) you really want to be a software engineer and have no prior experience or b) absolutely need it to graduate.  it's mostly busywork and stuff that you can learn in a decent summer internship at a software company (if you want to go into software).\nthat being said, gail is a wonderful person, and is very kind and understanding.  however, her lectures tend to be very dry and not very helpful, and the course materials aren't any better.  the course skims over component model frameworks, software testing and various software quality assurance techniques, but doesn't really go deep enough to make things useful.  most of these topics are covered briefly in lecture, and then exercised in a group project where they become a passing thought when completing your documentation.  by the end, you'll learn that you should do 'xx' and 'yy' if you're working in the software industry on a big project, but will be unsure as to what exactly qualifies as 'xx' or 'yy'.. workload: take home midterm and final, three easy homeworks in the beginning of the semester, and one semester long group project.  the group project is very hit or miss depending on your group (i chose poorly).  oh and five to six pop quizzes that really just check if you're sitting in lecture and still awake (it's hard sometimes...).", "the lectures during the first half of the class were informative. the paper, project, and presentation were fun. this is a rare class in the cs program in that you can elect not to be in a group! read that last sentence over again. i feel like way too much of my time has been wasted working with incompetent group members in other courses.\nthe only downside to this course is that you are forced to sit through the other student's presentations. as in you get major points deducted if you skip even one day during student presentations. many of your fellow students will not know how to give a presentation (dense text on slides, try to cover 40 slides in 10 minutes, mumble through the whole thing, etc). many of them will also not speak english very well, some not at all. i kind of feel like it is somewhat sadistic to make a student that barely speaks english give a presentation... and make other people sit through it as well. simple solution: bring a laptop and work on your project!. workload: 15 page paper on some web related topic of your choice and a pretty large programming project, again your choice, as long as it has to do with the web, and a 10 minute presentation. not bad for a 6000 level course.", "professor kaiser's lectures are generally quite well done. she uses lots and lots of powerpoint slides, which isn't generally my favorite approach -- i like it when lecturers use fewer slides, or just chalk and chalkboard if they can get away with it -- but she pulls it off pretty well.\nthe class organization is quite strong, particularly with regard to the major assignments (paper and project, both of which include several milestones to meet aside from the final submission.) the work required and assignment specs were all laid out pretty clearly at the beginning of the semester, which was really refreshing, actually. most of the other c.s. classes i've been in don't make specifications for assignments available until 1-3 weeks before they come due; it's hard to plan a semester that way.\ni'd say the course is intended to give a flavor of how web technology is used and how it developed -- up to and including the state of the art -- and it works well in that regard. a lot of information goes by quite fast, especially by the end, but students don't have to do all that much with lectures that don't relate to their project and paper, as there aren't exams.. workload: one research paper in the first half of the course (10-20 single-spaced pages), one web-related programming project in the second half (singly or in groups, about 1000-2000 lines of code per person), class participation (there is an attendance sheet), and a brief presentation on a topic of your choice (probably related to your paper or project.)", "professor kaiser is interested in her material and works hard at getting it across to her students.  the only thing is that she isn't the best at instructing students how to code within the complex component frameworks introduced in this course.  however, teams of students have freedom to choose a project of their liking, which is definitely preferred over a forced project such as robot wars or some ridiculous role playing game with clients, servers, and bots.  with the freedom to choose a project comes the desire to code the project.  gail follows up with the teams throughout the semester, giving feedback and ensuring that the students pick up on the material, and i've been more enthusiastic about this class than i had been with others within the compsci department.  don't be afraid of her first class when she tries to scare you off; you'll learn a lot, you'll learn how to document the software-development process, and if you work at your project, you'll walk out of the class knowing a great deal.. workload: team project with three iterations, as well as a take home midterm and take home final, both about the project's development and concepts discussed in class (and mentioned in the book)"], "summary": ["The student\u2019s opinion is mixed. Some students liked her course as an introduction to software engineering. Other students point out that the material can be learned from a summer internship. Her teaching style is okay, however, and the course is easy overall."]}
{"name": "Alwin J Franke", "reviews": ["if you asked my class to describe prof franke in one word, we would all say the same thing: king. i literally love this man and his frickin german accent. he is so understanding. my internet drops 24/7 and he's so nice about it. i've forgotten to do discussion posts a couple times, and both occasions he let me do them after they were supposed to be due. i'm also really impressed with how engaging he makes a two-hour class. the structure is kind of complicated, but i just go where i'm told and everything works out great. it's a mix of small group work and bigger group discussions, with a break in the middle. it's kind of amazing that i when i press that \"join meeting\" button i'm not overcome with dread at the imminence of having to sit on zoom for two straight hours. i went from not doing the readings at the start of the semester (oops) to doing all of them by the end because i wanted to get more out of class. if you get him for lithum, you're lucky!. workload: readings between every class (this is the hard part--sometimes they can be quite long, but i'd assume you'll find that in any lithum); discussions posts to go with most readings; three papers; one midterm conversation (no sweat); and a final group project. it sounds like a lot but it was honestly one of my lightest workload classes. the best thing about it is that the workload is generally consistent (plus prof is understanding) so you won't be too overwhelmed.", "alwin is straight up the sh*t. i had him before corona and after corona. in class he was great (as other reviewers have previously mentioned so i won't get to into it). when we switched onto online, he was still great. i think that shows the true talent of the professor. it appeared that he transitioned seamlessly onto the online format (although, i know that isn't true. he just never gave any indication that he was struggling with it). great, great! if you have him, you got a great get.. workload: super doable. some coursework posts. always easygoing with any extensions you need. he really cares about his students and wants to work with them to make sure that they are able to accomplish the work and actually learn something along the way.", "professor franke genuinely cares about his students and will relate the concepts in lithum to contemporary issues. he is very understanding and engages the class as much as possible. he's a very chill guy, and he teaches the course extremely well. he is always excited to teach, and this enthusiasm rubs off on all his students.. workload: there were definitely a lot of long discussion posts that took quite a bit of time in the first semester, but there weren't as many in the second. our midterm in the second semester was take-home, and the midterm for the first wasn't too bad! the workload is very doable.", "he is such a nice guy. he is genuinely very patient. always has been very accommodating with any extensions or requests needed. also, he makes class discussions very interesting. alot of my friends complain that they feel that lit hum is inapplicable to contemporary issues and themes; this has never been a question or thought walking out of his class.  he makes the class engaging, brings outside sources (like interviews, artwork, documentaries etc.) to show how these texts are still relevant. he also does a good balance of lecture and class discussions: for class discussion he only really monitors it to make sure contributions are equal. i'm not sure how his grading compares to other lit hum professors but i have always found his grading fair.. workload: doable. have to post a discussion post before every class (but these have never taken more than 30 minutes to accomplish). highly recommend him, he is the best! he also constantly checks in with the class to see if the workload is \"overwhelming.\" whenever it is clear that it is, he scales it back for a bit so we can have a breath.", "overall great class (for lithum). he puts a lot of effort into hearing multiple perspectives (both literally among the students and globally) and is willing to openly critique the core and its western focus. he's very open to feedback too, and generally a casual dude, which is good.\na relaxed grader, for the most part, esp. on the midterm. haven't got my final grade tho yet, so.. workload: some cheesy assignments, like drawing stuff, and you normally have to write like 300 words on canva before each class in addition to traditional lithum work (readings, essays)."], "summary": ["The professor is liked by the students.

{"name": "Patricia D Denison", "reviews": ["i must disagree with the previous review. pat denison is not useless. yes, sometimes her tangents may seem irrelevant in the beginning, but she always ties them back. she did an absolutely stunning job arranging the syllabus so that the readings related well and the class maintained a very nice flow. she contributes in discussions because she is interested in the material and has valuable knowledge and experiences to share. in this class, i always felt encouraged to share my thoughts even if they weren't fully developed yet. pd respects her students and recognizes how crazy life can be for them. i left this class with a great deal of knowledge and insight without once feeling overwhelmed by the workload. at the end of the semester, she invites the entire class to her apartment for a nice brunch. i felt like i developed a beneficial relationship with a thoughtful woman, not just a professor.. workload: quite manageable. 2 5-6pp papers and an in-class final essay.", "professor denison is, unfortunately, useless. she is a nice enough woman, but she is actually incapable of making some very interesting readings useful to you. her teaching style is ridiculous - this is a seminar class, and so discussion is supposed to be encouraged. she interrupts everyone, even the person making a presentation every lesson (which everyone has to do), and makes discussion virtually impossible. when she interrupts, her points are virtually useless - she is off-topic, she rambles, and she tells long, irrelevant anecdotes about her life. really, it makes this class suck.\nif you can avoid her, do. if you can't, i'm sorry.. workload: moderate if you do all the reading, light if you don't (which often is unnecessary).", "i don't know how exactly this happened, but i wandered into this class on the first day as a first-year without any concept of the fact that the class would be populated almost exclusively by seniors.\nprofessor denison warmly invited me to sit in on that first class, and told me at the end that i could stay.\nnow, as a junior, i realize what a gesture that was.  the difference in competence between a first-year and a senior's writing in an english class is huge, but professor denison gave me a chance to prove myself in a setting that was fun and interesting, albeit a bit loose in its organization.\ni earned a b+ at the end of the semester, and professor denison announced to the class while we sat in her apartment that i was the only first year there.\nfor me, prof. denison embodies the warmth, encouragement, and attention to individuals that barnard is all about.  along with a couple of other phenomenal english teachers, professor denison seduced me into and english major with a theater concentration, and has proven herself to be a thoughtful, helpful and caring advisor.\ni agree that if you appreciate a dry and empirical experience, the class is not for you.  however, if you can adapt to the conversational and elegant way that prof. denison shows her love for shakespeare's work, she will not only enchant you, but will remember your face as well as your work long after the class is over.. workload: weekly assignment to watch a performance, short midterm paper analyzing a passage from a shakespeare play and a thesis on a character an a theme in various performance settings.", "i don't know what the previous review was referring to, professor denison is not a joke. she is a charming, sweet, stylish woman who led wonderful discussions and

denison is always available for help outside the classroom. she is open about her life, telling the class stories about her daughters and inviting us to her home. the class environment was always engaging and insightful. i would recommend any class with this professor!. workload: a play a week, weekly postings, various videos and plays to see, two papers 5 pg and 20 pg. manageable especially

correct the tiniest grammatical mistakes.  completely mediocre class.. workload: standard for first-year seminar.  readings and a few papers.", "professor denison leads all her classes as if they are small seminars regardless of the number of students in the class.  as such,  the quality of her classes can depend on the intelligence of the students in it.  although she rarely lectures, she is very pleasant to listen to and always has a smile on her face. she runs a very laid-back class and is understanding of any extensions a student may need.  the syllabus for this class is wonderful (ibsen, chekhov, wilde, shaw) but is heavy on the victorian side with little of the more modern works.  if you like a chill atmosphere and and don't mind denison consistently coming 20 minutes late to every

politeness seemed to hold her back. without fail, after starting class fifteen minutes or more late the discussion would turn towards the tedious and trifle. she includes some great films, but the list of plays is almost completely tragedies. though we handed in weekly response papers and a draft (with few helpful comments and a lot of underlining), she was shockingly harsh on our final papers.

harsh grader and gettting a b+ is an accomplisment. it's a hard class to get an easy grade, but she's caring and you do learn in the class. so access yourself.. workload: response papers for every book read, 4 major papers, one class presentation and a final in-class essay.", "professor denison though offers little guidance in terms of class discussion (the students do it all). she seems to put
